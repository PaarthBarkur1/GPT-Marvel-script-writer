This place is huge.\\nI\\'ve seen bigger. There\\'s a bird in here.\\nHey, you brought your laptop, right?\\nWhy?\\nPeter,\\nwhy are we removing the tracker from your suit?\\nUh, because i gotta follow these guys\\nto their boss before they move again\\nand I don\\'t really want Mr. stark to know about it.\\nSo you\\'re lying to iron man now?\\nNo, I\\'m not lying.\\nHe just doesn\\'t really get what I can do yet.\\nOh, gotcha.\\nAll right, happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.\\nThere\\'s a ton of other subsystems in here.\\nHm?\\nBut they\\'re all disabled by the training wheels protocol.\\nWhat?\\n\"Training wheels protocol\"?\\nTurn it off.\\nI don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea.\\nThey\\'re blocked for a reason.\\nCome on, man, i don\\'t need training wheels.\\nI\\'m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.\\nIt\\'s not cool.

Yeah.\\nActivating instant kill.\\nNo, no, no, no. I don\\'t want to kill anybody.\\nDeactivating instant kill.\\nDid you hear that?\\nWhat the hell just happened? What was that?\\nYou jumped off the sign and landed on your face.\\nSuit lady, what\\'s wrong with my web-shooters?\\nRapid-fire is the default for enhanced combat mode.\\nWhy would I need rapid-fire?\\nWould you like to see more options?\\nYou have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.\\nMr. stark really overdid it.\\nYou two wait right here.\\nWait. You\\'re gonna want to turn on the dampers\\nor that thing will shatter your arm.\\nAll right, where\\'s the dampers?\\nThat one. Great choice.\\nWould you like me to set this as your new default?\\nNo, no, no. Push that in.\\nRight here? No, the other...\\nThis one here? Yeah, push it.\\nWhat was that?

Like, upstate-upstate?\\nYeah, let\\'s go.\\nTake a look.\\nIt\\'s pretty impressive, huh?\\nThey just finished remodeling the whole thing.\\nYou don\\'t see that every day. Oh, there they are.\\nHow was the ride up? Good.\\nGive me a minute with the kid.\\nSeriously? Yeah.\\nI got to talk to the kid.\\nI\\'ll be close behind.\\nHow about a loose follow?\\nAll right? Boundaries are good.\\nSorry I took your suit.\\nI mean, you had it coming.\\nActually, it turns out it was the perfect\\ntough-love moment that you needed, right?\\nTo urge you on? Wouldn\\'t you think?\\nDon\\'t you think? I guess.\\nLet\\'s just say it was.\\nMr. stark, I really...\\nYou screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.\\nBut then you did the right thing.\\nTook the dog to the free clinic,\\nyou raised the hybrid puppies.\\nAll right, not my best analogy.\\nI was wrong about you.\\nI think, with a little more mentoring,\\nyou could be a real asset to the team.\\nTo the... to the team? Yeah. Anyway,\\nthere\\'s about 50 reporters behind that door.\\nReal ones, not bloggers.\\nWhen you\\'re ready,\\nwhy don\\'t you try that on?\\nAnd I\\'ll introduce the world\\nto the newest official member of the avengers:\\nSpider-man.\\nI... heh.\\nYeah, give that a look.\\nSo after the press conference,\\nhappy will show you to your room, your new quarters.\\nWhere\\'s he between? He\\'s next to vision?\\nYeah, vision\\'s not big on doors.\\nIt\\'s fun. Or walls.\\nYou\\'ll fit right in.\\nThank you, Mr. stark,\\nbut I\\'m... I\\'m good.\\nYou\\'re good? How are you good?\\nWell, I mean, I\\'d rather just stay\\non the ground for a little while.\\nFriendly neighborhood spider-man.\\nSomebody\\'s got to look out for the little guy, right?\\nYou\\'re turning me down?\\nYou better think about this. Look at that.\\nLook at me.\\nLast chance. Yes or no?\\nNo. Okay.\\nIt\\'s kind of a Springsteen-y,\\nworking-class hero vibe that I dig.\\nAh, happy will take you home.\\nYeah? Yeah.\\nMind waiting in the car? I need a minute.\\nThank you, Mr. stark.\\nYes, Mr. Parker, very well.\\nSee you around. Okay.\\nThat was a test, right?\\nThere\\'s nobody back there?\\nYes, you passed.\\nAll right, skedaddle there, young buck.\\nThank you, Mr. stark. Thank you.\\nYeah, thank you.\\nTold you he was a good kid.\\nPepper! Pepper!\\nWhere\\'s the kid?\\nHe left. Everybody\\'s waiting.\\nHe actually made a really mature choice.\\nIt just surprised the heck out of us.\\nDid you guys screw this up?\\nHe told the kid to wait in the car.\\nAre you kidding me? I have a room full of people waiting\\nfor some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?\\nThink of something. How about, um,\\nhap, you still got that ring?\\nDo i... i...\\nThe engagement ring. Are you kidding?\\nI\\'ve been carrying this since 2008.\\nOkay.\\nI think I can think of something better than that.\\nWell, it would buy us a little time.\\nLike we need time.\\nI can\\'t believe you have that thing in your pocket.\\nLet me to get the door for you, hon?\\nI got it.\\nAunt may, did you do dinner already?\\nMay?\\nWhat the f...?!\\nLook who it is.\\nWhat are the odds you and I\\'d end up\\nat the same summer camp?\\nRelax.\\nThis? It\\'s not on you.\\nIt\\'s on our little spider friend.\\nI\\'ve got some boys on the outside\\nwho would love to meet him.\\nYou know, take a picture,\\nslice his throat, put his head in a dryer.\\nAnd I heard a rumor...\\nYou know who he is.\\nIf I knew who he was,\\nhe\\'d already be dead.\\nToomes, your family\\'s here!\\nHi, I\\'m captain America, here to talk to you\\nabout one of the most valuable traits\\na soldier or student can have.\\nPatience.\\nSometimes Patience is the key to victory.\\nSometimes it leads to very little\\nand it seems like it\\'s not worth it.\\nAnd you wonder\\nwhy you waited so long\\nfor something so disappointing.\\nHow many more of these?I feel like you\\'re driving me to a court-martial.\\nThis is crazy. What did I do?\\nI feel like you\\'re going to pull over and snuff me.\\nWhat, you\\'re not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!\\nWe can talk, sir.\\n- Oh, I see. So it\\'s personal? - No, you intimidate them.\\nGood God, you\\'re a woman. I honestly... I couldn\\'t have called that.\\nI mean, I\\'d apologize, but isn\\'t that what we\\'re going for here?\\n- I thought of you as a soldier first. - I\\'m an airman.\\nYou have, actually, excellent bone structure, there.\\nI\\'m kind of having a hard time not looking at you now.\\nIs that weird? Come on, it\\'s okay, laugh.\\n- Sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please.\\nIs it true you went 12 for 12 with last year\\'s Maxim cover models?\\nThat is an excellent question. Yes and no.\\nMarch and I had a scheduling conflict,\\nbut fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins.\\nAnything else? You\\'re kidding me with the hand up, right?\\n- Is it cool if I take a picture with you? - Yes. It\\'s very cool.\\nAll right.\\nI don\\'t want to see this on your MySpace page.\\nPlease, no gang signs.\\nNo, throw it up. I\\'m kidding.\\nYeah, peace. I love peace. I\\'d be out of a job with peace.\\nCome on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don\\'t change any settings. Just click it.\\n- What\\'s going on? - Contact left!\\nWhat have we got?\\nJimmy, stay with Stark!\\n- Stay down! - Yeah.\\nSon of a bitch!\\n- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun! - Stay here!\\nWhoa!\\nTony Stark.\\nVisionary. Genius.\\nAmerican patriot.\\nEven from an early age,\\nthe son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark\\nquickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind.\\nAt age four, he built his first circuit board.\\nAt age six, his first engine.\\nAnd at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT.\\nThen, the passing of a titan.\\nHoward Stark\\'s lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane,\\nsteps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder,\\nuntil, at age 21, the prodigal son returns\\nand is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries.\\nWith the keys to the kingdom,\\nTony ushers in a new era for his father\\'s legacy,\\ncreating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting.\\nToday, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry\\nby ensuring freedom and protecting America\\nand her interests around the globe.\\nAs liaison to Stark Industries,\\nI\\'ve had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot.\\nHe is my friend and he is my great mentor.\\nLadies and gentlemen, it is my honor\\nto present this year\\'s Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark.\\nTony?\\n- Thank you, Colonel. - Thanks for the save.\\nThis is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much.\\nThis is wonderful.\\nWell, I\\'m not Tony Stark.\\nBut if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel\\nand what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award.\\nTony, you know...\\nThe best thing about Tony is also the worst thing.\\nHe\\'s always working.\\nWork it! Come on!\\n- We should just stay till the morning. - You are unbelievable.\\n- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this? - Nobody roped me into anything!\\n- I\\'m so sorry. - But they told me that\\nif I presented you with an award, you\\'d be deeply honored.\\nOf course I\\'d be deeply honored. And it\\'s you, that\\'s great.\\n- So when do we do it? - It\\'s right here.\\n- Here you go. - There it is. That was easy.\\n- I\\'m so sorry. - Yeah, it\\'s okay.\\nWow! Would you look at that? That\\'s something else.\\nI don\\'t have any of those floating around.\\nWe\\'re gonna let it ride!\\nGive me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.\\nOkay, you, too.\\n- I don\\'t blow on a man\\'s dice. - Come on, honey bear.\\nThere it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\\nTwo craps. Line away.\\n- That\\'s what happens. - Worse things have happened.\\nI think we\\'re gonna be fine. Color me up, will you?\\n- This is where I exit. - All right.\\nTomorrow, don\\'t be late.\\n- Yeah, you can count on it. - I\\'m serious!\\nI know, I know.\\nRender unto Caesar that which is Caesar\\'s. There you go.\\nMr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!\\nChristine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine.\\nCan I ask you a couple of questions?\\n- She\\'s cute. - She\\'s all right?\\n- Hi. - Hi.\\n- Yeah. Okay, go. - It\\'s okay?\\nYou\\'ve been called the da Vinci of our time.\\n- What do you say to that? - Absolutely ridiculous. I don\\'t paint.\\nAnd what do you say to your other nickname?\\n\"The Merchant of Death\"?\\nThat\\'s not bad.\\n- Let me guess. Berkeley? - Brown, actually.\\nWell, Ms. Brown,\\nit\\'s an imperfect world, but it\\'s the only one we\\'ve got.\\nI guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace,\\nI\\'ll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\\nRehearse that much?\\nEvery night in front of the mirror before bedtime.\\n- I can see that. - I\\'d like to show you first-hand.\\nAll I want is a serious answer.\\nOkay, here\\'s serious. My old man had a philosophy,\\n\"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\"\\nThat\\'s a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.\\nMy father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project.\\nA lot of people, including your professors at Brown,\\nwould call that being a hero.\\nAnd a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.\\nTell me, do you plan to report on the millions we\\'ve saved\\nby advancing medical technology\\nor kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?\\nAll those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.\\nYou ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?\\nI\\'d be prepared to lose a few with you.\\nGood morning. It\\'s 7:00 a.m.\\nThe weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.\\nThe surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines.\\nHigh tide will be at 10:52 a.m.\\nTony?\\nHey, Tony?\\nYou are not authorized to access this area.\\n- Jesus. - That\\'s Jarvis. He runs the house.\\nI\\'ve got your clothes here. They\\'ve been dry-cleaned and pressed,\\nand there\\'s a car waiting for you outside\\nthat will take you anywhere you\\'d like to go.\\n- You must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.\\nAfter all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.\\nI do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires,\\nincluding, occasionally, taking out the trash.\\nWill that be all?\\nGive me an exploded view.\\nThe compression in cylinder three appears to be low.\\nLog that.\\n- I\\'m gonna try again, right now. - Please don\\'t turn down my music.\\nI\\'ll keep you posted.\\nYou are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.\\n- How\\'d she take it? - Like a champ.\\nWhy are you trying to hustle me out of here?\\nYour flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\\nThat\\'s funny, I thought with it being my plane and all,\\nthat it would just wait for me to get there.\\nTony, I need to speak to you about a couple things\\nbefore I get you out of the door.\\nDoesn\\'t it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane\\nif it departs before you arrive?\\nLarry called. He\\'s got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.\\nDo you want it? Yes or no.\\nIs it a good representation of his spring period?\\nNo. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton\\nwhere he lived and worked,\\n- not \"spring\" like the season. - So?\\nI think it\\'s a fair example. I think it\\'s incredibly overpriced.\\nI need it. Buy it. Store it.\\nOkay. The MIT commencement speech...\\nIs in June. Please, don\\'t harangue me about stuff that\\'s way, way, down...\\nThey\\'re haranguing me, so I\\'m gonna say yes.\\nDeflect it and absorb it. Don\\'t transmit it back to me.\\nI need you to sign this before you get on the plane.\\nWhat are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?\\n- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don\\'t like it when you have plans.\\nI\\'m allowed to have plans on my birthday.\\n- It\\'s your birthday? - Yes.\\nI knew that. Already?\\nYeah. Isn\\'t that strange? It\\'s the same day as last year.\\n- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.\\n- And? - It was very nice.\\n- Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\\nYou\\'re welcome, Miss Potts.\\nOkay.\\nYou\\'re good. I thought I lost you back there.\\nYou did, sir. I had to cut across Mulholland.\\nI got you. I got you.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with you?\\n- What? - Three hours.\\nI got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\\nFor three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.\\nWaiting on you now. Let\\'s go. Come on.\\nWheels up! Rock and roll!\\n- What you reading, platypus? - Nothing.\\nCome on, sour patch. Don\\'t be mad.\\nI told you, I\\'m not mad. I\\'m indifferent, okay?\\n- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark.\\nYou don\\'t need to apologize to me. I\\'m your man.\\nHi. I told him I was sorry, but he...\\n- I\\'m just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?\\nYou don\\'t respect yourself,\\n- so I know you don\\'t respect me. - I respect you.\\nI\\'m just your babysitter.\\nSo, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.\\nLet me know and I\\'ll get you a bottle, okay?\\nHey! Heat up the sake, will you?\\n- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I\\'m not talking...\\nWe\\'re not drinking. We\\'re working right now.\\n- You can\\'t have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally\\nincapable of being responsible.\\nIt would be irresponsible not to drink. I\\'m just talking about a nightcap.\\nHot sake?\\n- Yes, two, please. - No. I\\'m not drinking. I don\\'t want any.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about.\\nWhen I get up in the morning and I\\'m putting on my uniform,\\nyou know what I recognize?\\nI see in that mirror that every person that\\'s got this uniform on got my back!\\nHey, you know what? I\\'m not like you. I\\'m not cut out...\\nNo, no. You don\\'t have to be like me! But you\\'re more than what you are.\\nCan you excuse me if I\\'m a bit distracted here?\\nNo! You can\\'t be distracted right now! Listen to me!\\nGeneral.\\nWelcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.\\nThanks.\\nIs it better to be feared or respected?\\nI say, is it too much to ask for both?\\nWith that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel\\nof Stark Industries\\' Freedom Line.\\nIt\\'s the first missile system\\nto incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.\\nThey say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.\\nI respectfully disagree.\\nI prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.\\nThat\\'s how Dad did it. That\\'s how America does it.\\nAnd it\\'s worked out pretty well so far.\\nFind an excuse\\nto let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you\\nthe bad guys won\\'t even want to come out of their caves.\\nFor your consideration, the Jericho.\\nI\\'ll be throwing one of these in\\nwith every purchase of 500 million or more.\\nTo peace!\\n- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?\\nI couldn\\'t sleep till I found out how it went. How\\'d it go?\\nIt went great. Looks like it\\'s gonna be an early Christmas.\\nHey! Way to go, my boy! I\\'ll see you tomorrow, yeah?\\nWhy aren\\'t you wearing those pajamas I got you?\\nGood night, Tony.\\n- Hey, Tony. - I\\'m sorry, this is the \"fun-vee.\"\\nThe \"hum-drum-vee\" is back there.\\n- Nice job. - See you back at base.\\nI wouldn\\'t do that if I were you.\\nWhat the hell did you do to me?\\nWhat I did?\\nWhat I did is to save your life.\\nI removed all the shrapnel I could, but there\\'s a lot left,\\nand it\\'s headed into your atrial septum.\\nHere, want to see?\\nI have a souvenir. Take a look.\\nI\\'ve seen many wounds like that in my village.\\nWe call them the walking dead\\nbecause it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\\n- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,\\nhooked up to a car battery,\\nand it\\'s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.\\nThat\\'s right. Smile.\\nWe met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.\\n- I don\\'t remember. - No, you wouldn\\'t.\\nIf I had been that drunk, I wouldn\\'t have been able to stand,\\nmuch less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\\nWhere are we?\\nCome on, stand up. Stand up!\\nJust do as I do.\\nCome on, put your hands up.\\nThose are my guns. How did they get my guns?\\nDo you understand me? Do as I do.\\nHe says, \"Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer\\n\"in the history of America.\"\\nHe is honored.\\nHe wants you to build the missile.\\nThe Jericho missile that you demonstrated.\\nThis one.\\nI refuse.\\nTony!\\nHe wants to know what you think.\\nI think you got a lot of my weapons.\\nHe says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile.\\nHe wants you to make the list of materials.\\nHe says for you to start working immediately,\\nand when you\\'re done, he will set you free.\\n- No, he won\\'t. - No, he won\\'t.\\nI\\'m sure they\\'re looking for you, Stark.\\nBut they will never find you in these mountains.\\nLook, what you just saw,\\nthat is your legacy, Stark.\\nYour life\\'s work, in the hands of those murderers.\\nIs that how you want to go out?\\nIs this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?\\nOr are you going to do something about it?\\nWhy should I do anything? They\\'re going to kill me, you, either way.\\nAnd if they don\\'t, I\\'ll probably be dead in a week.\\nWell, then,\\nthis is a very important week for you, isn\\'t it?\\nIf this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up.\\nI need welding gear. I don\\'t care if it\\'s acetylene or propane.\\nI need a soldering station. I need helmets. I\\'m gonna need goggles.\\nI would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.\\n- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.\\nBut apparently, not enough for this place.\\nThey speak Arabic, Urdu,\\nDari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\\n- Who are these people? - They are your loyal customers, sir.\\nThey call themselves the Ten Rings.\\nYou know, we might be more productive\\nif you include me in the planning process.\\nOkay, we don\\'t need this.\\nWhat is that?\\nThat\\'s palladium, 0.15 grams.\\nWe need at least 1.6, so why don\\'t you go break down the other 11?\\nWhat\\'s he doing?\\nWorking.\\nCareful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.\\nRelax. I have steady hands.\\nWhy do you think you\\'re still alive?\\n- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.\\nYinsen. Nice to meet you.\\nNice to meet you, too.\\nThat doesn\\'t look like a Jericho missile.\\nThat\\'s because it\\'s a miniaturized arc reactor.\\nI got a big one powering my factory at home.\\nIt should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.\\nBut what could it generate?\\nIf my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.\\nThat could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.\\nYeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.\\n- This is our ticket out of here. - What is it?\\nFlatten them out and look.\\nOh, wow.\\nImpressive.\\nGood.\\nGood roll. Good roll.\\nYou still haven\\'t told me where you\\'re from.\\nI\\'m from a small town called Gulmira.\\n- It\\'s actually a nice place. - Got a family?\\nYes, and I will see them when I leave here.\\nAnd you, Stark?\\n- No. - No?\\nSo you\\'re a man who has everything\\nand nothing.\\nIt doesn\\'t look anything like the picture.\\nMaybe it\\'s been modified.\\nThe tail is wrong.\\nIt\\'s just backwards.\\nRelax.\\nThe bow and arrow\\nonce was the pinnacle of weapons technology.\\nIt allowed the great Genghis Khan\\nto rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.\\nAn empire twice the size of Alexander the Great\\nand four times the size of the Roman Empire.\\nBut today,\\nwhoever holds the latest Stark weapons\\nrules these lands.\\nAnd soon,\\nit will be my turn.\\nWhy have you failed me?\\nWe\\'re working.\\nDiligently.\\nI let you live.\\nThis is how you repay me?\\nIt\\'s very complex.\\nHe\\'s trying very hard.\\nOn his knees.\\nYou think I\\'m a fool?\\nI\\'ll get the truth.\\nWe\\'re both working.\\nOpen your mouth.\\nWhat does he want?\\nYou think I\\'m a fool?\\nWhat\\'s going on?\\nTell me the truth.\\nHe\\'s building your Jericho.\\nWhat do you want? A delivery date?\\nI need him.\\nGood assistant.\\nYou have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.\\nOkay? Can you move?\\nOkay, say it again.\\n41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,\\nthat\\'s from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.\\nWhere is Stark?\\nHe was here a moment ago.\\nGo look for him.\\nYinsen! Yinsen! Stark!\\nSay something. Say something back to him.\\n- He\\'s speaking Hungarian. I don\\'t... - Then speak Hungarian.\\n- Okay. I know. - What do you know?\\n- How\\'d that work? - Oh, my goodness.\\n- It worked all right. - That\\'s what I do.\\n- Let me finish this. - Initialize the power sequence.\\nOkay.\\n- Now! - Tell me. Tell me.\\nFunction 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar.\\n- It should be up right now. - Yes.\\nTalk to me. Tell me when you see it.\\n- I have it. - Press Control \"l\".\\n- \"I.\" Got it. - \"I.\" \"Enter.\" \"l\" and \"Enter.\"\\nCome over here and button me up.\\nOkay. All right.\\nEvery other hex bolt.\\n- They\\'re coming! - Nothing pretty, just get it done.\\n- Just get it done. - They\\'re coming.\\nMake sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?\\nWe need more time.\\nHey,\\n- I\\'m gonna go buy you some time. - Stick to the plan!\\nStick to the plan!\\nYinsen!\\n- Yinsen! - Watch out!\\nStark.\\nCome on. We got to go.\\nMove for me, come on. We got a plan. We\\'re gonna stick to it.\\nThis was always the plan, Stark.\\nCome on, you\\'re gonna go see your family. Get up.\\nMy family is dead.\\nI\\'m going to see them now, Stark.\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nI want this. I want this.\\nThank you for saving me.\\nDon\\'t waste it. Don\\'t waste your life.\\nMy turn.\\nNot bad.\\nHey!\\nHow was the \"fun-vee\"?\\nNext time, you ride with me, okay?\\nWatch it, coming up here.\\nAre you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.\\nYour eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?\\n- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting. - Yeah, vacation\\'s over.\\nWhere to, sir?\\n- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy. - No.\\nNo? Tony, you have to\\n- go to the hospital. - No is a complete answer.\\n- The doctor has to look at you. - I don\\'t have to do anything.\\nI\\'ve been in captivity for three months.\\nThere are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger,\\n- and the other... - That\\'s enough of that.\\n...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.\\n- Call for a press conference? - Yeah.\\n- What on earth for? - Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\\nLook at this!\\nTony.\\n- We were going to meet at the hospital. - No, I\\'m fine.\\nLook at you!\\n- You had to have a burger, yeah? - Well, come on.\\n- You get me one of those? - There\\'s only one left. I need it.\\nHey, look who\\'s here! Yeah!\\n- Miss Potts? - Yes.\\nCan I speak to you for a moment?\\nI\\'m not part of the press conference, but it\\'s about to begin right now.\\nI\\'m not a reporter.\\nI\\'m Agent Phil Coulson,\\nwith the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement\\nand Logistics Division.\\n- That\\'s quite a mouthful. - I know. We\\'re working on it.\\nYou know, we\\'ve been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...\\nWe\\'re a separate division with a more specific focus.\\nWe need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.\\n- I\\'ll put something in the book, shall I? - Thank you.\\nHey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?\\nWhy don\\'t you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...\\nA little less formal and...\\n- What\\'s up with the love-in? - Don\\'t look at me.\\nI don\\'t know what he\\'s up to.\\n- Good to see you. - Good to see you.\\nI never got to say goodbye to Dad.\\nI never got to say goodbye to my father.\\nThere\\'s questions that I would have asked him.\\nI would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.\\nIf he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.\\nOr maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels.\\nI saw young Americans killed\\nby the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.\\nAnd I saw\\nthat I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.\\n- Mr. Stark! - Hey, Ben.\\nWhat happened over there?\\nI had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more\\nto offer this world than just making things that blow up.\\nAnd that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down\\nthe weapons manufacturing division of Stark International\\nuntil such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.\\nI think we\\'re gonna be selling a lot of newspapers.\\nWhat direction it should take, one that I\\'m comfortable with\\nand is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well.\\nWhat we should take away from this is that Tony\\'s back!\\nAnd he\\'s healthier than ever.\\nWe\\'re going to have a little internal discussion\\nand we\\'ll get back to you with the follow-up.\\n- Where is he? - He\\'s inside.\\nWell, that... That went well.\\nDid I just paint a target on the back of my head?\\nYour head? What about my head?\\nWhat do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?\\n- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.\\nYep.\\nTony, we\\'re a weapons manufacturer.\\nObie, I just don\\'t want a body count to be our only legacy.\\nThat\\'s what we do. We\\'re iron mongers. We make weapons.\\nIt\\'s my name on the side of the building.\\nAnd what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.\\nNot based on what I saw.\\nWe\\'re not doing a good enough job.\\nWe can do better. We\\'re gonna do something else.\\nLike what? You want us to make baby bottles?\\nI think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.\\nCome on. The arc reactor, that\\'s a publicity stunt!\\nTony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up!\\n- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.\\nThe arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it.\\nArc reactor technology, that\\'s a dead end, right?\\nMaybe.\\nAm I right? We haven\\'t had a breakthrough in that in what?\\n- Thirty years. - That\\'s what they say.\\nCould you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?\\n- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It\\'s Rhodey or Pepper.\\n- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.\\n- Okay. - Okay?\\nIt works.\\nListen to me, Tony. We\\'re a team. Do you understand?\\nThere\\'s nothing we can\\'t do if we stick together,\\nlike your father and I.\\nI\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give you a heads-up, okay?\\n- But if I had... - Tony.\\nTony, no more of this \"ready, fire, aim\" business.\\n- You understand me? - That was Dad\\'s line.\\nYou gotta let me handle this.\\nWe\\'re gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.\\nWe\\'re going to have to take a lot of heat.\\nI want you to promise me that you\\'re gonna lay low.\\nStark Industries!\\nI\\'ve got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?\\nSell, sell, sell!\\nAbandon ship!\\nDoes the Hindenburg ring any bells?\\nLet me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!\\nLook, that\\'s a weapons company that doesn\\'t make weapons!\\nPepper. How big are your hands?\\n- What? - How big are your hands?\\n- I don\\'t understand why... - Get down here. I need you.\\nHey.\\nLet\\'s see them. Show me your hands.\\nLet\\'s see them.\\nOh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed.\\nI just need your help for a sec.\\nOh, my God, is that the thing that\\'s keeping you alive?\\nIt was. It is now an antique.\\nThis is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.\\nI\\'m swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.\\n- Speed bump, what does that mean? - It\\'s nothing. It\\'s just a little snag.\\nThere\\'s an exposed wire under this device.\\nAnd it\\'s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.\\nIt\\'s fine.\\n- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.\\n- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!\\nI want you to reach in, and you\\'re just gonna gently lift the wire out.\\n- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.\\nIt\\'s like Operation. You just don\\'t let it touch\\nthe socket wall or it goes \"beep.\"\\n- What do you mean, \"Operation\"? - It\\'s just a game, never mind.\\n- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great. - Okay.\\nYou know, I don\\'t think that I\\'m qualified to do this.\\nNo, you\\'re fine. You\\'re the most capable, qualified,\\ntrustworthy person I\\'ve ever met. You\\'re gonna do great.\\nIs it too much of a problem to ask? \\'Cause I\\'m...\\n- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.\\nOkay.\\nOh, there\\'s pus!\\nIt\\'s not pus. It\\'s an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,\\n- not from my body. - It smells!\\nYeah, it does.\\nThe copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?\\n- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?\\nNow, don\\'t let it touch the sides when you\\'re coming out!\\nI\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.\\nThat\\'s what I was trying to tell you before.\\nOkay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don\\'t...\\nThere\\'s a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.\\n- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...\\n- Don\\'t put it back in! Don\\'t put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?\\nWhat\\'s wrong?\\nNothing, I\\'m just going into cardiac arrest\\n\\'cause you yanked it out like a trout...\\n- What? You said it was safe! - We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.\\n- You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.\\n- Tony? It\\'s going to be okay. - What?\\n- Is it? - It\\'s gonna be okay.\\n- I\\'m gonna make this okay. - Let\\'s hope.\\nOkay, you\\'re gonna attach that to the base plate. Make sure you...\\nWas that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here.\\nNice.\\n- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great.\\nYou okay?\\nDon\\'t ever, ever, ever,\\never ask me to do anything like that ever again.\\nI don\\'t have anyone but you.\\nAnyway...\\n- What do you want me to do with this? - That?\\nDestroy it.\\nIncinerate it.\\nYou don\\'t want to keep it?\\nPepper, I\\'ve been called many things. \"Nostalgic\" is not one of them.\\n- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - That will be all, Miss Potts.\\nHey, Butterfingers, come here.\\nWhat\\'s all this stuff doing on top of my desk?\\nThat\\'s my phone, that\\'s a picture of me and my dad.\\nRight there. In the garbage. All that stuff.\\nThe future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?\\nI\\'ll tell you, in my experience,\\nno unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot\\'s instinct,\\nhis insight,\\nthat ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious\\nand discern its outcome, or a pilot\\'s judgment.\\nColonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?\\nLook who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.\\n- Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned,\\nyou gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong\\nat spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987.\\n- That lovely lady you woke up with. - Don\\'t do that!\\n- What was his name? - Don\\'t do that.\\n- Was it Ivan? - Don\\'t do that.\\nThey\\'ll believe it. Don\\'t do that.\\n- Okay. - Don\\'t do that.\\n- Pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys.\\n- I\\'m surprised. - Why?\\nI swear, I didn\\'t expect to see you walking around so soon.\\nI\\'m doing a little better than walking.\\n- Really? - Yeah.\\nRhodey, I\\'m working on something big.\\nI came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.\\nYou\\'re about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy,\\n\\'cause that little stunt at the press conference,\\nthat was a doozy.\\nThis is not for the military. I\\'m not... It\\'s different.\\nWhat? You\\'re a humanitarian now or something?\\n- I need you to listen to me. - No.\\nWhat you need is time to get your mind right.\\n- I\\'m serious. - Okay.\\nIt\\'s nice seeing you, Tony.\\nThanks.\\n- Jarvis, you up? - For you, sir, always.\\nI\\'d like to open a new project file, index as Mark II.\\nShall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?\\nActually, I don\\'t know who to trust right now.\\nTill further notice, why don\\'t we just keep everything on my private server?\\nWorking on a secret project, are we, sir?\\nI don\\'t want this winding up in the wrong hands.\\nMaybe in mine, it can actually do some good.\\nNext. Up.\\nNot in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me?\\nStay put. Nice.\\nYou\\'re of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this.\\nOkay, I\\'m sorry, am I in your way?\\nUp.\\nScrew it. Don\\'t even move.\\nYou are a tragedy.\\nOkay, let\\'s do this right.\\nStart mark, half a meter, and back and center.\\nDummy, look alive. You\\'re on standby for fire safety.\\nYou, roll it.\\nOkay. Activate hand controls.\\nWe\\'re gonna start off nice and easy.\\nWe\\'re gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift.\\nAnd three,\\ntwo,\\none.\\nUp two. All right, set that.\\nI\\'ve been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?\\nYeah, everything\\'s... What?\\n- Obadiah\\'s upstairs. - Great!\\n- What would you like me to tell him? - Great. I\\'ll be right up.\\nOkay.\\nI thought you said you were done making weapons.\\nIt is.\\nThis is a flight stabilizer. It\\'s completely harmless.\\nI didn\\'t expect that.\\nHow\\'d it go?\\nIt went that bad, huh?\\nJust because I brought pizza back from New York\\n- doesn\\'t mean it went bad. - Sure doesn\\'t. Oh, boy.\\nIt would have gone better if you were there.\\nYou told me to lay low. That\\'s what I\\'ve been doing.\\n- I lay low, and you take care of all... - Hey, come on. In public. The press.\\n- This was a board of directors meeting. - This was a board of directors meeting?\\nThe board is claiming you have posttraumatic stress.\\nThey\\'re filing an injunction.\\n- A what? - They want to lock you out.\\nWhy, \\'cause the stocks dipped 40 points?\\nWe knew that was gonna happen.\\n- Fifty-six and a half. - It doesn\\'t matter.\\nWe own the controlling interest in the company.\\nTony, the board has rights, too.\\nThey\\'re making the case that you and your new direction\\n- isn\\'t in the company\\'s best interest. - I\\'m being responsible!\\nThat\\'s a new direction for me, for the company.\\nI mean, me on the company\\'s behalf being responsible for the way that...\\nThis is great.\\n- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I\\'ll be in the shop.\\nHey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.\\nI\\'m trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something.\\nSomething to pitch them.\\nLet me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.\\n- No. No, absolutely not. - It\\'ll give me a bone to throw the boys\\n- in New York! - This one stays with me.\\n- That\\'s it, Obie. Forget it. - All right, well, this stays with me, then.\\nGo on, here, you can have a piece.\\n- Take two. - Thank you.\\nYou mind if I come down there and see what you\\'re doing?\\nGood night, Obie.\\nDay 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option,\\nDummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again,\\nand I\\'m not on fire, I\\'m donating you to a city college.\\nAll right, nice and easy.\\nSeriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity.\\nAnd three, two, one.\\nOkay.\\nPlease don\\'t follow me around with it, either,\\n\\'cause I feel like I\\'m gonna catch on fire spontaneously.\\nJust stand down! If something happens, then come in.\\nAnd again, let\\'s bring it up to 2.5.\\nThree, two, one.\\nOkay, this is where I don\\'t want to be!\\nNot the car, not the car!\\nTable!\\nCould be worse! Could be worse! We\\'re fine! Okay.\\nNo!\\nYeah, I can fly.\\n- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir.\\n- Engage Heads Up Display. - Check.\\nImport all preferences from home interface.\\nWill do, sir.\\nAll right, what do you say?\\nI have indeed been uploaded, sir. We\\'re online and ready.\\nCan we start the virtual walk-around?\\nImporting preferences and calibrating virtual environment.\\nDo a check on control surfaces.\\nAs you wish.\\nTest complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.\\nYeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check.\\nStart listening in on ground control.\\nSir, there are still terabytes\\nof calculations needed before an actual flight is...\\nJarvis! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk.\\nReady? In three, two, one.\\nHandles like a dream.\\nAll right, let\\'s see what this thing can do.\\nWhat\\'s SR-71 \\'s record?\\nThe altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\\nRecords are made to be broken! Come on!\\nSir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.\\nKeep going!\\nHigher!\\nWe iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps! Jarvis!\\nCome on, we got to break the ice!\\nKill power.\\nNotes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.\\nHull pressurization is problematic. I\\'m thinking icing is the probable factor.\\nA very astute observation, sir.\\nPerhaps, if you intend to visit other planets,\\nwe should improve the exosystems.\\nConnect to the sys. Co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.\\nUse the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.\\nThat should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.\\n- Got it? - Yes.\\nShall I render using proposed specifications?\\nThrill me.\\nTonight\\'s red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall,\\nwhere Tony Stark\\'s third annual benefit for the Firefighter\\'s Family Fund\\nhas become the place to be for L.A.\\'s high society.\\nJarvis, we get an invite for that?\\nI have no record of an invitation, sir.\\n...hasn\\'t been seen in public\\nsince his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.\\nSome claim he\\'s suffering from posttraumatic stress\\nand has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,\\nno one expects an appearance from him tonight.\\nThe render is complete.\\nA little ostentatious, don\\'t you think?\\nWhat was I thinking? You\\'re usually so discreet.\\nTell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.\\nYes, that should help you keep a low profile.\\nThe render is complete.\\nHey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\\nCommencing automated assembly.\\nEstimated completion time is five hours.\\nDon\\'t wait up for me, honey.\\nWeapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries\\nis all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...\\n- Hey, Tony, remember me? - Sure don\\'t.\\nYou look great, Hef.\\nWe\\'re going to have a great quarter.\\nWhat\\'s the world coming to when a guy\\'s got to crash his own party?\\nLook at you. Hey, what a surprise.\\nI\\'ll see you inside.\\nHey. Listen, take it slow, all right?\\nI think I got the board right where we want them.\\nYou got it. Just cabin fever. I\\'ll just be a minute.\\n- Give me a Scotch. I\\'m starving. - Mr. Stark?\\n- Yeah? - Agent Coulson.\\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the...\\nStrategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.\\nGod, you need a new name for that.\\nYeah, I hear that a lot.\\nListen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you.\\nThere\\'s still a lot of unanswered questions,\\nand time can be a factor with these things.\\nLet\\'s just put something on the books.\\nHow about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. At Stark Industries?\\nTell you what. You got it. You\\'re absolutely right.\\nWell, I\\'m going to go to my assistant, and we\\'ll make a date.\\nYou look fantastic! I didn\\'t recognize you.\\n- What are you doing here? - Just avoiding government agents.\\n- Are you by yourself? - Yes. Where\\'d you get that dress?\\n- Oh, it was a birthday present. - That\\'s great.\\n- From you, actually. - Well, I got great taste.\\nYes.\\n- You want to dance? - Oh, no.\\n- All right, come on. - Thank you. No.\\nAm I making you uncomfortable?\\nNo. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss\\nin front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.\\n- You look great and you smell great. - Oh, God.\\nBut I could fire you if that would take the edge off.\\nI actually don\\'t think that you could tie your shoes without me.\\n- I\\'d make it a week. Sure. - Really?\\nWhat\\'s your Social Security number?\\n- Five. - Five?\\n- Right. - Right.\\nYou\\'re missing just a couple of digits there.\\nThe other eight? So I got you for the other eight.\\n- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air.\\n- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless.\\nIt was totally not harmless, by the way.\\nWe\\'re dancing. No one\\'s even watching.\\nEverybody who I work with... No, you know why?\\nI think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.\\nNo, it was not just a dance. You don\\'t understand because you\\'re you.\\nAnd everybody knows exactly who you are\\nand how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine.\\nBut, you know, then me, you\\'re my boss,\\n- and I\\'m dancing with you. - I don\\'t think it was taken that way.\\nBecause it makes me look like the one who\\'s trying to...\\n- I just think you\\'re overstating it. - You know, and we\\'re here,\\nand then I\\'m wearing this ridiculous\\ndress, and then we were dancing like that and...\\n- I would like a drink, please. - Got it, okay.\\n- I would like a vodka martini, please. - Okay.\\nVery dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\\nTwo vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast.\\nMake one of them dirty, will you?\\nWow. Tony Stark.\\n- Oh, hey. - Fancy seeing you here.\\n- Carrie. - Christine.\\nThat\\'s right.\\nYou have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.\\nCan I at least get a reaction from you?\\nPanic. I would say panic is my reaction.\\n\\'Cause I was referring to your company\\'s\\ninvolvement in this latest atrocity.\\nYeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don\\'t know what to tell you.\\nI actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.\\nI was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn\\'t hear.\\nIs this what you call accountability?\\nIt\\'s a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?\\n- When were these taken? - Yesterday.\\n- I didn\\'t approve any shipment. - Well, your company did.\\nWell, I\\'m not my company.\\n- Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures?\\n- What\\'s going on in Gulmira? - Tony, Tony.\\n- You can\\'t afford to be this naive. - You know what? I was naive before,\\nwhen they said, \"Here\\'s the line. We don\\'t cross it.\\n\"This is how we do business.\"\\nIf we\\'re double-dealing under the table... Are we?\\nTony, your picture, please!\\nLet\\'s take a picture. Come on. Picture time!\\nTony. Who do you think locked you out?\\nI was the one who filed the injunction against you.\\nIt was the only way I could protect you.\\nNo. No.\\nThe 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described\\nas a descent into hell, into a modern day Heart of Darkness.\\nSimple farmers and herders from peaceful villages\\nhave been driven from their homes,\\ndisplaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power.\\nVillagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings\\nthey can find in the ruins of other villages,\\nor here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.\\nRecent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters\\nreferred to by locals as the Ten Rings.\\nAs you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.\\nA mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way.\\nWith no political will or international pressure,\\nthere\\'s very little hope for these refugees.\\nAround me, a woman begging for news on her husband,\\nwho was kidnapped by insurgents,\\neither forced to join their militia...\\nDesperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs,\\nholding them up to anyone who will stop.\\nA child\\'s simple question, \"Where are my mother and father?\"\\nThere\\'s very little hope for these refugees,\\nrefugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.\\nHurry it up.\\nPut the women in the trucks.\\nStack the weapons here.\\nClear all the houses.\\nThat one there. Faster. Faster.\\nGrab that dog.\\nPut him with the others.\\nWhat the hell is this?\\nShoot this dog.\\nYou\\'re all incompetent.\\nTurn your head.\\nHe\\'s all yours.\\nWhat the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?\\nNo, they were using human shields. We never got the green light.\\nPut me through to State. They\\'re going to be all over this.\\nGet those monitors up!\\nWe got a bogey!\\n- Wasn\\'t Air Force! - We got the CIA on the line?\\nI\\'ve got Langley on the line. They want to know if it\\'s us.\\nNo, it definitely is not us, sir!\\n- It wasn\\'t Navy. - Wasn\\'t Marines.\\nI need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?\\n- Negative, negative. - Cannot identify.\\nGet me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons Development down here now!\\nWe ran an ID check and cross-referenced\\nwith all known databases. We have nothing.\\nAny high altitude surveillance in the region?\\nWe got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.\\nSo this thing just appeared out of nowhere?\\nHow come it didn\\'t show up on the radar?\\nGot a minimal radar cross-section, sir.\\n- Is it stealth? - No, sir, it\\'s tiny.\\nWe think it\\'s an unmanned aerial vehicle.\\nColonel, what are we dealing with here?\\n- Let me make a call. - Sergeant, clear a hole.\\n- Hello? - Tony?\\n- Who\\'s this? - It\\'s Rhodes.\\n- Sorry, hello? - I said it\\'s Rhodes.\\n- Speak up, please. - What in the hell is that noise?\\n- Oh, yeah, I\\'m driving with the top down. - Yeah, well, I need your help right now.\\nIt\\'s funny how that works, huh?\\nYeah. Speaking of funny, we\\'ve got a weapons depot that was just blown up\\na few clicks from where you were being held captive.\\nWell, that\\'s a hot spot.\\nSounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?\\nWhy do you sound out of breath, Tony?\\nI\\'m not, I was just jogging in the canyon.\\n- I thought you were driving. - Right, I was driving\\nto the canyon, where I\\'m going to jog.\\nYou sure you don\\'t have any tech in that area I should know about?\\n- Nope! - Bogey spotted!\\n- Whiplash, come in hot. - Okay, good, \\'cause I\\'m staring at one\\nright now, and it\\'s about to be blown to kingdom come.\\nThat\\'s my exit.\\nBallroom, this is Whiplash One. I\\'ve got the bogey in my sights.\\nWhiplash One, what is it?\\nI\\'ve got no idea.\\n- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir.\\nThen you are clear to engage.\\nHit it.\\nThat bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!\\n- Inbound missile. - Flares!\\nWait a second. Bogey deployed flares!\\nDeploy flaps!\\nHoly!\\nThat thing just jumped off the radar, sir.\\nThe sat visual has been lost.\\nNo way that\\'s a UAV.\\nWhat is it?\\nI can\\'t see anything.\\nWhatever it was, it just bought the farm.\\nI think bogey\\'s been handled, sir.\\n- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it\\'s me.\\n- It\\'s who? - I\\'m sorry, it is me.\\nYou asked. What you were asking about is me.\\nNo, see, this isn\\'t a game.\\nYou do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone.\\n- You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment.\\nI\\'m in it. It\\'s a suit. It\\'s me!\\nRhodey, you got anything for me?\\n- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom.\\nOn your belly!\\nIt looks like a man!\\nShake him off! Roll! Roll!\\nI\\'m hit! I\\'m hit!\\nIt\\'s confirmed. He has been hit.\\nPunch out! Punch out!\\nWhiplash One down.\\nWhiplash Two, do you see a chute?\\nNegative! No chute, no chute!\\nMy chute\\'s jammed!\\nSir, I\\'ve got a visual on the bogey.\\nWhiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.\\nMajor, we don\\'t even know what we\\'re shooting at.\\n- Call off the Raptors. - That thing just took out an F-22\\ninside a legal no fly zone!\\nWhiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!\\nYou\\'ve been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.\\nKeep going!\\nGood chute! Good chute!\\n- Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks.\\nOh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.\\nYou owe me a plane. You know that, right?\\nYeah, well, technically, he hit me.\\nNow are you going to come by and see what I\\'m working on?\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better.\\nNow, what am I supposed to tell the press?\\nTraining exercise. Isn\\'t that the usual BS?\\nIt\\'s not that simple.\\nAn unfortunate training exercise\\ninvolving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday.\\nI am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured.\\nAs for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira,\\nit is still unclear who or what intervened,\\nbut I can assure you that the United States government was not involved.\\nHey!\\nIt is a tight fit, sir.\\nSir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.\\nBe gentle. This is my first time.\\nI designed this to come off, so... Hey.\\n- I really should be able to... - Please, try not to move, sir.\\nWhat\\'s going on here?\\nLet\\'s face it. This is not the worst thing you\\'ve caught me doing.\\nAre those bullet holes?\\nWelcome.\\nCompliments of Tony Stark.\\nIf you\\'d killed him when you were supposed to, you\\'d still have a face.\\nYou paid us trinkets to kill a prince.\\nShow me the weapon.\\nCome. Leave your guards outside.\\nHis escape bore unexpected fruit.\\nSo this is how he did it.\\nThis is only a first, crude effort.\\nStark has perfected his design.\\nHe has made a masterpiece of death.\\nA man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia.\\nAnd you dream of Stark\\'s throne.\\nWe have a common enemy.\\nIf we are still in business,\\nI will give you these designs\\nas a gift.\\nAnd in turn,\\nI hope you\\'ll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers.\\nThis is the only gift you shall receive.\\nTechnology.\\nIt\\'s always been your Achilles\\' heel in this part of the world.\\nDon\\'t worry. It\\'ll only last for 15 minutes.\\nThat\\'s the least of your problems.\\nCrate up the armor and the rest of it.\\nAll right, let\\'s finish up here.\\nSet up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor,\\nand I\\'m going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers.\\nI want a prototype right away.\\nHey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?\\nI need you to go to my office.\\nYou\\'re going to hack into the mainframe and you\\'re going to retrieve all\\nthe recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip.\\nThis\\'ll get you in.\\nIt\\'s probably under Executive Files.\\nIf not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need\\nto look for the lowest numeric heading.\\nAnd what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?\\nSame drill.\\nThey\\'ve been dealing under the table, and I\\'m going to stop them.\\nI\\'m going to find my weapons and destroy them.\\nTony,\\nyou know that I would help you with anything,\\nbut I cannot help you if you\\'re going to start all of this again.\\nThere is nothing except this. There\\'s no art opening.\\nThere is no benefit. There is nothing to sign.\\nThere is the next mission and nothing else.\\nIs that so?\\nWell, then, I quit.\\nYou stood by my side all these years\\nwhile I reaped the benefits of destruction.\\nAnd now that I\\'m trying to protect the people\\nthat I put in harm\\'s way, you\\'re going to walk out?\\nYou\\'re going to kill yourself, Tony. I\\'m not going to be a part of it.\\nI shouldn\\'t be alive,\\nunless it was for a reason.\\nI\\'m not crazy, Pepper.\\nI just finally know what I have to do.\\nAnd I know in my heart that it\\'s right.\\nYou\\'re all I have, too, you know.\\nSector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?\\nYou did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.\\n- As you can see, Obadiah Stane... - Oh, my God.\\n...your deception and lies will cost you dearly.\\nThe price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.\\nSo, what are we going to do about this?\\nI know what you\\'re going through, Pepper.\\nTony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn\\'t he?\\nI was so happy when he came home.\\nIt was like we got him back from the dead.\\nNow I realize,\\nwell, Tony never really did come home, did he?\\nHe left a part of himself in that cave.\\nBreaks my heart.\\nWell, he\\'s a complicated person.\\nHe\\'s been through a lot. I think he\\'ll be all right.\\nYou are a very rare woman.\\nTony doesn\\'t know how lucky he is.\\nThank you. Thanks.\\nI\\'d better get back there.\\nIs that today\\'s paper?\\nYes.\\nDo you mind?\\n- Not at all. - Puzzle.\\nOf course.\\nTake care.\\nMs. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?\\nNope, right now. Come with me.\\n- Right now? - We\\'re going to have it right now.\\n- Yeah, walk with me. - Okay.\\nI\\'m going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.\\nYeah, we\\'ve been working our best to do it.\\nAbsolutely, we\\'re... I\\'m going to have to call you back.\\nMr. Stane? Sir, we\\'ve explored\\nwhat you\\'ve asked us, and it seems as though there\\'s a little hiccup.\\n- Actually... - A hiccup?\\nYes, to power the suit, sir, the technology actually doesn\\'t exist.\\n- So it\\'s... - Wait, wait, wait. The technology?\\nWilliam, here is the technology. I\\'ve asked you to simply make it smaller.\\nOkay, sir, and that\\'s what we\\'re trying to do, but honestly, it\\'s impossible.\\nTony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!\\nWell, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not Tony Stark.\\nTony?\\nTony, are you there? Hello?\\nBreathe.\\nEasy, easy.\\nYou remember this one, right?\\nIt\\'s a shame the government didn\\'t approve it.\\nThere\\'s so many applications for causing short-term paralysis.\\nTony.\\nWhen I ordered the hit on you,\\nI worried that I was\\nkilling the golden goose.\\nBut, you see, it was just\\nfate that you survived that.\\nYou had one last golden egg to give.\\nDo you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?\\nYour father, he helped give us the atomic bomb.\\nNow, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you?\\nOh, it\\'s beautiful.\\nTony, this is your Ninth Symphony.\\nWhat a masterpiece. Look at that.\\nThis is your legacy.\\nA new generation of weapons with this at its heart.\\nWeapons that will help steer the world back on course,\\nput the balance of power in our hands.\\nThe right hands.\\nI wish you could see my prototype.\\nIt\\'s not as...\\nWell, not as conservative as yours.\\nToo bad you had to involve Pepper in this.\\nI would have preferred that she lived.\\nWhat do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?\\nPepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah...\\nOkay, where\\'s Tony now?\\nI don\\'t know. He\\'s not answering his phone.\\nPlease go over there and make sure everything\\'s okay.\\nThank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.\\nGood boy.\\nTony?\\nTony!\\nTony! You okay?\\n- Where\\'s Pepper? - She\\'s fine. She\\'s with five agents.\\nThey\\'re about to arrest Obadiah.\\nThat\\'s not going to be enough.\\nSection 16. Section 16. There it is.\\nMy key\\'s not working. It\\'s not opening the door.\\nOh, wow! What\\'s that? It\\'s, like, a little device?\\nIt\\'s, like, a thing that\\'s going to pick the lock?\\nYou might want to take a few steps back.\\nThat\\'s the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen.\\nNot bad, huh? Let\\'s do it.\\nYou need me to do anything else?\\nKeep the skies clear.\\nDamn!\\nNext time, baby.\\nLooks like you were right. He was building a suit.\\nI thought it\\'d be bigger.\\nTake him out!\\nHow do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?\\nThe suit\\'s at 48% power and falling, sir.\\nThat chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.\\nKeep me posted.\\nPepper!\\n- Tony! Tony, are you okay? - I\\'m fine. How are...\\n- Obadiah, he\\'s gone insane! - I know.\\n- Listen, you\\'d better get out of there. - He built a suit.\\nGet out of there right now!\\nWhere do you think you\\'re going?\\nYour services are no longer required.\\nStane!\\nI love this suit!\\n- Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony.\\nDivert power to chest RT.\\nPower reduced to 19%.\\nLady!\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!\\nFor 30 years, I\\'ve been holding you up!\\nI built this company from nothing!\\nNothing is going to stand in my way.\\nLeast of all you!\\nImpressive! You\\'ve upgraded your armor!\\nI\\'ve made some upgrades of my own!\\nSir, it appears that his suit can fly.\\nDuly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.\\nWith only 15% power, the odds of reaching that...\\nI know the math! Do it!\\nSir, you\\'re not going to believe this. That thing is back.\\nGet me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!\\nNot necessary, people. Just a training exercise.\\nYes, sir.\\n- Thirteen percent power, sir. - Climb!\\n- Eleven percent. - Keep going!\\n- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!\\nStop telling me!\\nYou had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!\\nHow\\'d you solve the icing problem?\\nIcing problem?\\nMight want to look into it.\\nTwo percent.\\nWe are now running on emergency backup power.\\n- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?\\nI\\'m almost out of power. I\\'ve got to get out of this thing. I\\'ll be right there.\\nNice try!\\n- Weapons status? - Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.\\nFlares!\\nVery clever, Tony.\\n- Potts? - Tony!\\nThis isn\\'t working.\\nWe\\'re going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.\\n- Well, how are you going to do that? - You\\'re going to do it.\\nGo to the central console, open up all the circuits.\\nWhen I get clear of the roof, I\\'ll let you know.\\nYou\\'re going to hit the master bypass button.\\nIt\\'s going to fry everything up here.\\nOkay. I\\'m going in now.\\nMake sure you wait till I clear the roof. I\\'ll buy you some time.\\nThis looks important!\\nI never had a taste for this sort of thing,\\nbut I must admit, I\\'m deeply enjoying the suit!\\nYou finally outdid yourself, Tony!\\nYou\\'d have made your father proud!\\nIt\\'s ready, Tony! Get off the roof!\\nTony!\\nHow ironic, Tony!\\nTrying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!\\n- Pepper! - And now I\\'m going to kill you with it!\\n- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!\\n- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!\\n- Just do it! - You\\'ll die!\\nPush it!\\nTony!\\nYou\\'ve all received the official statement of what occurred\\nat Stark Industries last night.\\nThere have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned\\nand caused damage to the arc reactor.\\nFortunately, a member of Tony Stark\\'s personal security staff...\\n\"Iron Man.\" That\\'s kind of catchy. It\\'s got a nice ring to it.\\nI mean, it\\'s not technically accurate. The suit\\'s a gold-titanium alloy,\\nbut it\\'s kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.\\nHere\\'s your alibi.\\nOkay.\\n- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.\\nWe have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,\\nand sworn statements from 50 of your guests.\\nSee, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me\\nalone on the island.\\n- That\\'s what happened. - All right.\\nJust read it, word for word.\\nThere\\'s nothing about Stane here.\\nThat\\'s being handled. He\\'s on vacation.\\nSmall aircraft have such a poor safety record.\\nBut what about the whole cover story that it\\'s a bodyguard?\\nHe\\'s my... I mean, is that... That\\'s kind of flimsy, don\\'t you think?\\nThis isn\\'t my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.\\nJust stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you.\\nYou\\'ve got 90 seconds.\\nAgent Coulson?\\nI just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.\\nThat\\'s what we do. You\\'ll be hearing from us.\\n- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nRight.\\n- Let\\'s get this show on the road. - You know, it\\'s actually not that bad.\\nEven I don\\'t think I\\'m Iron Man.\\n- You\\'re not Iron Man. - Am so.\\n- You\\'re not. - All right, suit yourself.\\nYou know, if I were Iron Man, I\\'d have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.\\nShe\\'d be a wreck, \\'cause she\\'d always be worrying that I was going to die,\\nyet so proud of the man I\\'d become.\\nShe\\'d be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more\\ncrazy about me.\\nTell me you never think about that night.\\n- What night? - You know.\\nAre you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof,\\nand then you went downstairs to get me a drink,\\nand you left me there, by myself?\\nIs that the night you\\'re talking about?\\nThought so.\\n- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.\\nAnd now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement.\\nHe will not be taking any questions. Thank you.\\nBeen a while since I was in front of you. I figure I\\'ll stick to the cards this time.\\nThere\\'s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred\\non the freeway and the rooftop...\\nI\\'m sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that\\nthat was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,\\n- despite the fact that you... - I know that it\\'s confusing.\\nIt is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely\\nto make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\\'m a superhero.\\nI never said you were a superhero.\\nDidn\\'t? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic.\\nI\\'m just not the hero type. Clearly.\\nWith this laundry list of character defects,\\nall the mistakes I\\'ve made,\\n- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.\\nYeah, okay. Yeah.\\nThe truth is\\nI am Iron Man.\\nJarvis!\\nWelcome home, sir.\\n\"I am Iron Man.\" You think you\\'re the only superhero in the world?\\nMr. Stark, you\\'ve become part of a bigger universe.\\nYou just don\\'t know it yet.\\nWho the hell are you?\\nNick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nI\\'m here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.Nick, this was a tragedy, but it\\'s not why we\\'re here.\\nWhat, are we fighting the weather now?\\nLocals say the cyclone had a face.\\nPeople see things when they\\'re under stress.\\nThat does not mean that this is the start to some other big world-ending\\nWho are you?\\nYou don\\'t want any part of this.\\nGone but not forgotten.\\nThanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy\\nfor their help with that touching video tribute.\\nThis year has been nothing short of ***. It is crazy. It\\'s insane.\\nJason. What?\\nNo swearing.\\nIt\\'s the last day of school. We\\'re good.\\nHistoric.\\nOver five years ago, half of all life in the universe,\\nincluding our own Midtown High, was wiped from existence.\\nThen eight months ago, a band of brave heroes\\nbrought us back.\\nThey called it \"the Blip.\"\\nThose of us who Blipped away came back the same age\\nBut our classmates that didn\\'t Blip had grown five years older.\\nMy little brother is now older than me. Yeah, it\\'s math.\\nEven though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year\\nand had already taken midterms,\\nthe school made us start the whole year over from the beginning.\\nIt\\'s totally unfair.\\nIt\\'s not right.\\nTigers, it\\'s been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road.\\nAs we draw this year to a close,\\nit\\'s time to move on\\nto a new phase of our lives. Pray nothing crazy happens again\\nbecause are the Avengers even a thing anymore?\\nDoes anyone even have a plan? I have a plan.\\nOkay, first, I\\'m gonna sit next to MJ on the flight.\\nSecond, I\\'m gonna buy a dual-headphone adapter\\nand watch movies with her the whole time.\\nOkay. Three, when we go to Venice\\nVenice is famous for making stuff out of glass, right?\\nTrue. So I\\'m gonna buy her\\na black dahlia necklace because her favorite flower is the black dahlia\\nbecause of, well The murder.\\nThe murder. Four, when we go to Paris,\\nI\\'m gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower,\\ngive her the necklace.\\nThen, five, I\\'m gonna tell her how I feel.\\nThen, six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way.\\nOh, don\\'t forget step seven.\\nStep seven? Don\\'t do any of that.\\nWhy? We\\'re gonna be bachelors in Europe.\\nNed. Look,\\nI may not know much, but I do know this:\\nEuropeans love Americans.\\nReally? More than half of them are women.\\nOkay. Sure.\\nBut I really like MJ, man, okay?\\nShe\\'s awesome, she\\'s super funny in a kind of dark way.\\nSometimes I catch her looking at me, I feel like I\\'ve stood up\\nShe\\'s coming. Don\\'t say anything. What up, dorks?\\nExcited about the science trip? Hey, we\\'re talking about the trip.\\nYeah, and Peter\\'s plan. You have a plan?\\nI don\\'t I don\\'t have a plan.\\nNo, he\\'s just gonna collect tiny spoons when we\\'re traveling to other countries.\\nLike a grandmother?\\nI\\'m not collecting tiny spoons. He\\'s collecting tiny spoons.\\nOh, okay, well\\nthat was a real roller coaster.\\nBy the way, travel tip:\\nYou should download a VPN on your phone,\\nso the government can\\'t track you while we\\'re abroad.\\nSmart. Will do.\\nDude, I think that went really great.\\nWhen I Blipped back to my apartment,\\nthe family that was living there was very confused.\\nThe wife thought that I was a mistress.\\nThe grandma thought that I was a ghost. It was It was really a mess.\\nThank you for coming out\\nto support those who have been displaced by the Blip.\\nAnd, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man!\\nThank you, Miss Parker, for having me.\\nAnd thank you, you guys, for having me.\\nAnd thank you, Spider-Man.\\nHe\\'ll be right back out to take photos and videos. Thank you!\\nThat was amazing. That was great.\\nThat was so cool. I was so nervous. I was a little stiff. I wasn\\'t in the pocket.\\nI thought you did great.

Thank you.\\nI think I\\'m gonna go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagna.\\nSpider-Man, go shake hands.\\nWill do.\\nWhat just happened?\\nHeads up, Nick Fury\\'s calling you.\\nFury\\'s gonna call me? Why? Yeah.\\nWhy? He probably has hero stuff for you to do.\\nYou\\'re a superhero. He calls superheroes.\\nIf it was that important, he\\'d probably call someone else, not me.\\nApparently not.\\nNo caller ID. That\\'s him. I don\\'t wanna talk to Fury.\\nAnswer the phone. Why?\\nIf you don\\'t talk to him, I have to, and I don\\'t want to.\\nWhy not? Because I\\'m scared. Answer the phone.\\nYou sent Nick Fury to voicemail? Yeah.\\nYou don\\'t send Fury to voicemail.

It has to be.\\nBuzzFeed says there\\'s a sailor named Morris Bench\\nwho was exposed to an experimental underwater generator\\nand got hydro powers.\\nYeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the Internet.\\nSpider-Man could take him. What do you think it is?\\nBeing a man of science\\nwitches.\\nNo, no, no. We wanna stay.\\nGood thing I packed your suit.\\nI can\\'t believe you forgot it. Yeah.\\nSo who was that guy that you were with? Was that Mr. Strange?\\nDoctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.

He came by to volunteer.\\nAnd he\\'s hanging around the office.\\nAnd he wants to say hi. I don\\'t want Hi, Peter.\\nHey, Happy.\\nSorry, I\\'m working hard here. I gotta do a A leaflet drop.\\nWhat are you doing? Glad you\\'re having a good time.\\nDon\\'t worry, I\\'m really taking care of your aunt.\\nSo how\\'s the plan going?\\nThere\\'s been setbacks, for sure.\\nDon\\'t overthink it. Trust your instincts and you\\'ll be fine.\\nI know. Love you.\\nBye.\\nWho is that guy?\\nHe\\'s like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.\\nHe\\'s all right. He\\'s no Spider-Man.\\nWhat is it with you and Spider-Man?\\nWhat? He\\'s just awesome, okay?\\nHe protects the neighborhood and he\\'s inspiring.\\nHe inspires me to be a better man.\\nWhat\\'s up, dickwad? Thought you drowned.\\nSounds like his name\\'s Mysterio.\\n\"L\\'uomo del misterio\" is Italian for \"man of mystery.\"\\nThey don\\'t actually know who he is. Mysterio.\\nCool name. Cool name.\\nBabe. Babe.\\nSo how much of that did you see?\\nNot much. I was running.\\nRight. Me too. I was also running\\naway.\\nSo Paris tomorrow.\\nGo to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.\\nYeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind-control antenna\\nto create an army of the insane.\\nWhich is why it\\'s my favorite destination on the whole trip.\\nWhat are you gonna do about the water monster?\\nNothing.\\nIt\\'s dead. Besides, that Mysterio guy\\'s all over it.\\nI just wanna spend some time with MJ.\\nWe were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me.\\nThat\\'s nice.\\nReminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love.\\nI had just finished my fruit cobbler, right, and\\nYou\\'re a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.\\nYou\\'re Nick Fury.\\nAnd you just shot Ned.\\nIt\\'s a mild tranquilizer. He\\'ll be all right.\\nSo good to finally meet you.\\nI saw you at the funeral,\\nbut I didn\\'t think that was a good time to exchange numbers.\\nThat would\\'ve been inappropriate.\\nThat\\'s what I just said. Right.\\nThe important thing is, you\\'re here. I tried to bring you here.\\nYou avoided me, and now you\\'re here.\\nWhat a coincidence.\\nWait. Was this a coincidence?\\nI used to know everything.\\nThen I come back five years later, and now I know nothing.\\nNo intel, no team.\\nAnd a high school kid\\nis dodging my calls.\\nHere\\'s what I do know:\\nA week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone.\\nWitnesses say that cyclone had a face.\\nThree days later, a similar event in Morocco.\\nA village was\\nJust making the rounds.\\nSee if anyone needs any counseling after today\\'s traumatic events.\\nNo, we\\'ll be okay. We\\'re fine. Thank you.\\nGreat because I\\'m I\\'m not qualified to actually\\nOh, he\\'s passed out.\\nI\\'m not qualified to do it anyway, so good night.\\nThat was my teacher. Sorry about that. You were saying?\\nA village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening\\nBabe, you still awake? You\\'re not answering any of my texts.\\nHe\\'s asleep, Betty.\\nOh, already?\\nYeah. Okay.\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s imperative\\nHey, boys. So that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria\\nAnother person touches that door, we are going to attend another funeral.\\nSuit up. Let me know if you develop vomiting.\\nStark left these for you.\\nReally?\\n\"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.\"\\nStark said you wouldn\\'t get that because it\\'s not a Star Wars reference.\\nYou can lose the mask. Everyone here has seen you without it.\\nYou\\'d be feigning anonymity\\nand breathing through spandex for no good reason.\\nCome on.\\nYeah.\\nOver there, we have Maria Hill.\\nThat is Dimitri.\\nAnd this is Mr. Beck.\\nMysterio?\\nWhat?\\nDoesn\\'t matter. It\\'s just what my friends have been calling you.\\nWell, you can call me Quentin.\\nYou handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower.\\nWe could use someone like you on my world.\\nThanks.\\nI\\'m sorry. Your world?\\nMr. Beck is from Earth.\\nJust not yours.\\nThere are multiple realities.\\nThis is Earth Dimension 616. I\\'m from Earth 833.\\nSorry, you\\'re saying there\\'s a multiverse?\\nI thought that was theoretical.\\nThat changes how we understand the initial singularity.\\nWe\\'re talking about an eternal inflation system.\\nHow does that even work with all the quantum?\\nIt\\'s insane.\\nSorry. It\\'s really cool.\\nDon\\'t ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.\\nAnyway\\nThey were born in stable orbits within black holes.\\nCreatures formed from the primary elements:\\nAir, water, fire, earth.\\nThe Science Division had a technical name.\\nWe just called them Elementals.\\nVersions of them exist across our mythologies.\\nTurns out, the myths are real.\\nLike Thor.\\nThor was a myth, now I study him in my physics class.\\nThese myths are threats.\\nThey first materialized on my Earth many years ago.\\nWe mobilized and fought them,\\nbut with each battle, they grew, got stronger.\\nI was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them.\\nAll we did was delay the inevitable.\\nThe Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates.\\nOur satellites confirm it.\\nThank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three.\\nThere\\'s only one left: fire.\\nThe strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth.\\nIt\\'s the one that took my family.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nAnd it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.\\nWe have one mission: kill it. And you\\'re coming with us.\\nI\\'m sorry, did you say Prague?\\nMr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.\\nAnd I\\'m just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.\\nBitch, please. You\\'ve been to space.\\nI know, but that was an accident.\\nThere\\'s gotta be someone else you can use.\\nWhat about Thor? Off-world.\\nOkay, Doctor Strange.\\nUnavailable. Captain Marvel.\\nDon\\'t invoke her name.\\nSir, look, I wanna help. I do.\\nBut if my aunt finds out I left my class trip, she\\'ll kill me.\\nAnd if I\\'m seen in Europe after the Washington Monument,\\nmy class will figure out who I am, then\\nThen the whole world will figure out who I am, and then I\\'m done.\\nOkay.\\nI understand.\\nI\\'m sorry, what?\\nWhy don\\'t you get back before your teachers miss you\\nand become suspicious.\\nDimitri.\\nTake him back to the hotel, please.\\nYes.\\nThank you, Mr. Fury.\\nAnd good luck.\\nSee you, kid.\\nYeah, see you.\\nBye, ma\\'am. Yeah.\\nDrink lots of water. I\\'m gonna get you a vitamin C pill.\\nYou cannot get sick, okay? Okay. Thanks, baby.\\nHey, are you sure you\\'re good?\\nOh, dude, I\\'m fine.\\nOkay. Nice. Don\\'t worry.\\nGetting tranq\\'d in the neck by Nick Fury,\\nprobably the coolest thing to ever happen to me.\\nIt is pretty awesome. Yeah.\\nI\\'m happy I don\\'t have to go to Prague. Seriously.\\nGood news. We\\'re going to Prague.\\nWhat? Prague?\\nYeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us.\\nYou should\\'ve heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell.\\nAll I heard was crying.\\nLook at our upgraded ride. Whoa, bro, you see that?\\nIt\\'s pretty sick.\\nI\\'m impressed, Mr. Harrington. Oh, come on.\\nPeter, what? What\\'s going on?\\nI think Nick Furyjust hijacked our summer vacation.\\nI\\'m Mr. Harrington to the kids\\nOh, all right. Okay.\\nAwesome.\\nYeah. Awesome.\\nYo, what\\'s up, Flash Mob?

The opera?\\nDon\\'t look at me. What happened to the carnival?\\nThis is upgrade living.\\nCome on. The tour company just gave us these tickets.\\nFor free! Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?\\nNo, because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.\\nI think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.\\nThank you, Ned.\\nEveryone, this is gonna be, maybe,\\nthe best four hours of our whole trip.\\nFour hours?\\nGuys, I think this is gonna be really fun. Seriously.\\nI bet now you\\'re all happy I had you pack a nice outfit.\\nYeah, because we\\'d much rather go to a four-hour opera\\ninstead of the biggest party in the world.\\nAgain, don\\'t look at me.\\nParker, do you copy?\\nComm check, one, two.\\nOkay, here we are. Beat the rush.\\nYeah, the rush out.\\nLucky for us, we got the best seats in the house.\\nLet\\'s go.\\nHey. I\\'ll save you a seat.\\nYou look really pretty.

Is that?\\nDo you think that\\'s Spider-Man?\\nNo, no, no. It\\'s a European rip-off version of him.\\nI actually read about him. It\\'s not him.\\nNo, Beck! He\\'s got the carousel!\\nHe\\'s getting bigger!\\nWhat\\'s his name? What\\'s his name?\\nIt\\'s Night Night Monkey.\\nNight Monkey? Yeah.\\nYeah. Night Monkey!\\nYeah. Night Monkey. Night Monkey, help!\\nSave us! Night Monkey, we\\'re stuck! What?\\nOh, no, no. Help us! Help!\\nAre you okay?\\nOn to Plan B?\\nYeah! We gotta hit him with something he can\\'t absorb!\\nI go left, you go right! Now!\\nOkay, shoot him!\\nYeah!\\nThat hurt him. Keep it coming.\\nSpider-Man, keep your distance.\\nI\\'m trying!\\nCan\\'t let him get near the Ferris wheel.\\nOkay. I\\'m on it!\\nWhoa, what is that?!\\nBetty! Betty!\\nThat\\'s it! Nice! Nice! You got him!\\nNo, no, no.\\nIt\\'s too late.\\nWhatever happens\\nI\\'m glad we met.\\nBeck, what are you doing?\\nWhat I should have done last time.\\nBeck, don\\'t do it!\\nBeck!\\nMr. Beck?\\nOh, thank God.\\nI would kiss you, but I think I threw up in my mouth a little.\\nI might have a mint.\\nSo it\\'s over?\\nThat was the last of them.\\nBut not the last threat we\\'ll ever face.\\nWe need to stay vigilant.\\nThere\\'s a void in this world for someone like you.\\nHill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.\\nYou should join us.\\nThank you. I just might take you up on that.\\nYou got gifts, Parker, but you didn\\'t wanna be here.\\nMr. Fury, I I\\'d love to have you in Berlin too.\\nBut you got to decide whether you\\'re going to step up or not.\\nStark chose you.\\nHe made you an Avenger.\\nI need that.\\nThe world needs that.\\nMaybe Stark was wrong.\\nWas he?\\nThe choice is yours.\\nLet\\'s get a drink.\\nI\\'m not 21.\\nHey.\\nYou gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight.\\nYeah.\\nFury was right.\\nTony did a lot for me\\nso I owe it to him, to everybody.\\nDo you?\\nYeah. I mean\\nMr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.\\nHe wanted me to be better than him.\\nAnd Fury wants me to live up to that. What do you want?\\nWhat do you mean? What do you want?\\nI don\\'t know. What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.\\nI know you\\'re thinking about it. I wanna go on my trip.\\nI want to go back on my trip with my friends.\\nAnd go to the top of the Eiffel Tower\\nwith the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel\\nand give her a kiss.\\nShut up, man.\\nYou\\'re not gonna do that, are you? No, I can\\'t.\\nWhy not?\\nBecause I have too much of a responsibility.\\nMy God. Thank you so much. What are those?\\nAre those the? EDITH glasses, yeah.\\nThey were just on the floor? Try them on. Let\\'s see how they look on you.\\nYeah? Yeah.\\nI actually really like them.\\nCan I be completely honest with you? Please.\\nThey look really stupid.\\nBut maybe they have a contact-lens version.\\nYou try them on.\\nNo, come on. Try them on.\\nI don\\'t wanna try them on. Just put them on.\\nWhat do you think, kid?\\n\"Next Tony Stark, I trust you.\"\\n\"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\"\\nWhat?\\nStark left me a message with those glasses:\\n\"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\"\\nI\\'m still not following. How many lemonades have you had?\\nHe knew every mistake I ever made.\\nHe must\\'ve known I wasn\\'t ready for something like this.\\nWhy give it to you?\\nMaybe he didn\\'t trust me to have EDITH, he just trusted me to pick who should.\\nIt makes much more sense. He knew I\\'d do what\\'s right.\\nAnd he\\'s not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would give himself EDITH.\\nYou\\'re probably right.\\nRight, so the world needs the next Iron Man.\\nAnd it\\'s not me. I\\'m a 16-year-old kid from Queens.\\nIt needs to be an adult with some experience\\nand that\\'s good like Tony Stark, like you.\\nNo. Peter, come on. No.\\nEDITH? Hello, Peter.\\nHi. Yeah\\nI\\'d like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.\\nPeter, what are you doing? Doing the right thing.\\nAny transfer will require confirmation. Stark gave you the glasses.\\nStark gave me a choice. It\\'s my choice to make, okay? And I\\'m gonna make it.\\nYou\\'re a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals.\\nYou saved my life. You saved the world, okay?\\nHe\\'d want you to have them.\\nWaiting for confirmation.\\nConfirm.\\nWelcome to the Avengers.\\nThey look good on you.\\nThank you.\\nIt\\'s an honor.\\nYeah.\\nMr. Stark would\\'ve really liked you.\\nWhere you headed?\\nI\\'m gonna go find MJ. Good luck, kid.\\nI\\'ll give you a fifty-fifty chance. You\\'re pretty awkward.\\nYeah.\\nSee you later, man. See you.\\nSee? That wasn\\'t so hard.\\nYes!\\nSomebody get this stupid costume off me!\\nOkay, we got EDITH.\\nGet these connected to our system.\\nToast! Toast! Toast!\\nNo, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.\\nToast! Toast! Toast!\\nYeah!\\nOkay, toasts!\\nGive me that, Doug.\\nTo the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony Stark.\\nThe jester king.\\nLiterally wrapped in wealth and technology\\nthat he was unfit to wield.\\nLike the holographic system I designed.\\nA revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications\\nthat Tony turned into a self-therapy machine\\nand renamed\\nBinarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.\\nOh, $611 million for my little therapeutic experiment.\\nHe renamed my life\\'s work \"BARF.\"\\nI told him it was a mistake,\\nthat my technology could change the world.\\nAnd then\\nhe fired me.\\nSaid I was\\nunstable.\\nTo Tony. To Tony!\\nNext, to William. William!\\nTony Stark was able to build this in a cave!\\nWith a box of scraps!\\nThe integration of my illusion tech\\nwith your weaponized drones was brilliant.\\nPowerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm.\\nAnd it\\'s just the beginning.\\nThank you, brother. To Guterman.\\nGuterman! To Guterman!\\nThe story you created of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin\\nfighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous\\nand apparently the kind of thing people will believe right now.\\nI mean, everybody bought it.\\nGutes! Guterman!\\nTo Victoria. To Victoria!\\nStaging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site\\nso Fury\\'s own satellites would confirm our lies.\\nInspired idea.\\nTo Janice. Janice!\\nAfter Tony died, she was the one who discovered that EDITH\\nwas being handed over not to us, not to the Defense Department,\\nbut to a child.\\nThank you. To Janice!\\nAnd to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone.\\nThere is a window of opportunity, and someone will step up.\\nBut these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room,\\nthe most qualified, and no one cares.\\nUnless you\\'re flying around with a cape or shooting lasers from your hands,\\nno one will even listen.\\nWell, I\\'ve got a cape and lasers.\\nWith our technology and with EDITH,\\nMysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth!\\nYeah!\\nThen everyone will listen!\\nNot to a boozy man-child. No!\\nNot to a hormonal teenager.\\nNo!\\nTo me\\nand to my very wealthy crew.\\nTo us. To us.\\nTo Mysterio! To Mysterio!\\nTo Peter Parker. To Peter Parker!\\nPoor kid.\\nLet\\'s get to work.\\nPeter, oh, my God. Hey. Hey.\\nWe almost died. It\\'s fine. It\\'s fine.\\nHey, I\\'m done with the mission.\\nDude, the trip\\'s over. What?\\nThere\\'s monsters coming out of the ground.\\nOf course our parents want us home.\\nDon\\'t put me on hold. Peter, you\\'re not dead.\\nOh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here. Don\\'t Put some clothes on.\\nWe\\'re booking flights.\\nWe came for science, we\\'re leaving because of witches.\\nWelcome to the new Dark Ages.\\nWhat is going on? We\\'re going home in the morning.\\nNo, no. All the Elementals are gone.\\nNed. Coming, sweetie.\\nHey, can you guys keep it down? I\\'m live-streaming.\\nYeah. Hey.\\nHey. Where were you?\\nI got lost. We were worried about you.\\nGood thing you\\'re back. Yeah.\\nSo much for Paris. It would\\'ve been fun.\\nYeah. Night. Night.\\nYou look ni\\nOkay.\\nHey. Hey.\\nLook\\nI\\'m not ready for this trip to be over yet, and I kind of want to do something fun\\nthat\\'s not on the itinerary or planned or with Mr. Harrington.\\nYes.\\n\"Yes,\" like you wanna go?\\nYes.\\nAwesome. I\\'ll see you outside in 10 minutes.\\nMeet me outside in five minutes.\\nFive is good. Okay.\\nOkay, bye. Bye.\\nNight Monkey, help us! Help! Night Monkey!\\nHey. Hey.\\nWhere do you wanna go?\\nWho cares? Awesome.\\nOkay. Let\\'s go.\\nI\\'m glad we\\'re doing this. Yeah, me too.\\nTo see the city a bit.\\nThey used to execute people on this bridge.\\nThey would put them in a basket, and they would drown in the water.\\nSorry. It\\'s okay.\\nThere\\'s this thing I\\'ve been wanting to talk to you about\\nfor a while.\\nYeah?\\nIt\\'s our last night in Europe,\\nand I had this plan that I wanted to tell you.\\nI\\'m just gonna tell you.\\nMJ, I \"I\\'m Spider-Man.\"\\nWhat? That\\'s what you were gonna say.\\nThat you\\'re Spider-Man.\\nNo. I\\'m not Spider-Man.\\nI\\'ve been watching you for a while now.\\nIt\\'s kind of obvious.\\nI\\'m not Spider-Man.\\nWhat would make you think that I was Spider-Man?\\nPeter, Washington? Yeah?\\nThe fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason.\\nNo, I was sick. Remember? I had my The tummy?\\nSusan Yang thinks you\\'re a male escort.\\nWhat? Of course I\\'m not a male escort.\\nThen you\\'re Spider-Man. I\\'m not Spider-Man at all.\\nWhat about tonight? You snuck off, and you fought that thing. I saw you.\\nYou can\\'t have seen me because I\\'m not Spider-Man.\\nAlso, on the news, it was the Night Monkey.\\nThe Night Monkey? Yeah.\\nThat\\'s what it said on the news,\\nand the news never lies.\\nNight Monkey. Okay. What are you doing?\\nWell, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man use the same webs?\\nI mean, maybe.\\nMaybe he\\'s a Spider Monkey. Who knows?\\nWere you only watching me because you thought I was Spider-Man?\\nYeah.\\nWhy else would I be watching you?\\nDoesn\\'t matter. Just thought that maybe\\nWhat the hell was that?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nWhat is it, some kind of projector or something?\\nYeah, but it\\'s really advanced.\\nIt It looked so real.\\nIt Yeah, really real.\\nWait, does that mean that? The Elementals are fake?\\nThat doesn\\'t make any sense because we were there, right?\\nThere was fire and destruction, and\\nWho would do something like that?\\nMysterio.\\nI am Spider-Man.\\nAnd I\\'ve really messed up. Wait. You\\'re being serious?\\nYou\\'re 100 percent serious? Because it\\'s not funny.\\nNo, I\\'m not joking.\\nBecause I was I was only like 67 percent sure.\\nMJ So why are you here?\\nWhy are you on this school trip? I know you have a lot of questions,\\nbut we have to get out of here, okay?\\nOkay. Okay. I can\\'t believe I figured it out!\\nYou took everything from me!\\nThis is for my family!\\nPause.\\nPause.\\nSorry.\\nYeah, can you just fast-forward to the end?\\nYep. Stand by.\\nAll right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.\\nPause. I\\'m not in love with this choreography, but it\\'ll do.\\nKill image.\\nDe-cloak drones.\\nAll right, weapons.\\nYou want to weaponize? Yep.\\nWeapons only. Stand by.\\nNice. Stop.\\nSomething. I don\\'t know what it is. It\\'s something\\nJust dou You know what? Double the damage and then run it again.\\nYou want me to double it up?\\nYeah. All right.\\nCover your ears.\\nThat is good! That\\'s good.\\nWe on schedule? Oh, yeah.\\nUploading software hack to EDITH network.\\nWith her drones, we\\'ll create an event big enough to cover an entire city.\\nAll right, well done.\\nMake sure every drone is weapons-hot. We need maximum damage.\\nThat is gonna cause a lot of casualties. Oh, yeah.\\nMore casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static.\\nLondon is a beautiful city, and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.\\nIf I\\'m the next Iron Man,\\nI need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat.\\nBut when its new savior descends,\\nall those casualties will be forgotten.\\nJanice, you\\'ll be in position with my quick-change armor for the victory lap?\\nOf course. Do you wanna try?\\nNo, no, that\\'s What\\'s going on with my hand?\\nWhy is that happening?\\nOh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector.\\nIt\\'s fine.\\nWait, and you\\'re? You\\'re telling me this now?\\nIt\\'s It\\'s one drone.\\nThe image will be perfect, I promise. That projector is evidence.\\nIt\\'s going to tell people what we\\'re doing and how we\\'re doing it.\\nI am trying to fool 7 billion people here, including Nick Fury,\\nwho happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet.\\nIf he catches on before I\\'ve killed him, he will put a bullet in my head.\\nAnd nobody wants a bullet in their head, right?\\nRight?\\nWilliam, can you look at me?\\nPull up EDITH.\\nHello, Quentin.\\nHi, honey. I need a level-five search, full-resource protocol for this device.\\nMagnifying.\\nThere. Search everything going in and out of that building.\\nLocated.\\nShit.\\nYou know, William, one day,\\nafter I\\'ve had to kill Peter Parker because of this,\\nI hope you remember that his blood is on your hands!\\nI can\\'t believe I gave Beck those glasses. How could I be that stupid?\\nHe\\'s probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me.\\nYou had access to killer drones?\\nYeah, I didn\\'t really want them, especially after I almost killed Brad.\\nYou almost killed Brad?\\nLook, I have to call Mr. Fury and tell him that Beck\\'s a fraud\\nbut I think he tapped my phone. So, what are you gonna do?\\nI need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin\\nand talk to Mr. Fury in person.\\nJust\\nOh, Ned, perfect.\\nThe costume looks great\\nfor the costume party at the prince\\'s castle.\\nShe knows. I told her.\\nHe didn\\'t tell me. I figured it out.\\nThat\\'s cool. Like, a long time ago.\\nLook, Mysterio is a fraud. But he saved me and Betty\\'s lives.\\nHe\\'s been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.\\nYeah, he\\'s using these, like, hologram projectors.\\nThat\\'s crazy.\\nYeah.\\nSo you guys were working the case together or what?\\nIt\\'s been mostly me.\\nNed, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington,\\nsay she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin, okay?\\nGot it. Easy.\\nWow, you guys lie with such ease.\\nI gotta go. Wait, wait, wait. The projector.\\nYou\\'re gonna need this.\\nDon\\'t tell anyone about this, okay? Anyone who knows is in danger.\\nSo you know too.\\nIt\\'s cool.\\nI\\'ve known first, and I\\'ve known longer, but it\\'s not a competition.\\nExcuse me. Do you know where? Nacht Monkey!\\nNo, wait, I didn\\'t Oh, man.\\nGet in.\\nMr. Fury You\\'ve got a lot of explaining to do.\\nNo, no, no, listen. Wait until we\\'re secure.\\nOkay.\\nRight.\\nSo is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend?\\nHe\\'s talking about EDITH.\\nI know I made a mistake, and I\\'m sorry, but he is not who you think he is.\\nBeck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it\\'s all fake.\\nHe has some sort of illusion tech.\\nThat\\'s how he tricked you and tricked me into giving him EDITH.\\nIt\\'s a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.\\nSo all that death and destruction we witnessed\\nwas created by this?\\nNo, not just this. I think he\\'s using drones.\\nWell, if this is true, then Beck\\'s very dangerous and we need to be smart.\\nWho else did you tell about this?\\nParker? Parker!\\nWhat\\'s wrong? It\\'s Beck. He\\'s here.\\nWhat? Hill?\\nNo, it\\'s just an illu\\nFury!\\nWow, Peter, wow.\\nI thought we were close.\\nFury always had to die, but not you.\\nStop hiding, Beck!\\nI tried to help you walk away.\\nNow you\\'re making me do this.\\nYou told me, you were just a kid.\\nYou told me, you wanted to run after that girl.\\nHelp me! MJ!\\nOh, God!\\nPeter, what\\'s going on? I know this isn\\'t real.\\nDo you, though?\\nMJ! MJ!\\nI don\\'t think you know what\\'s real, Peter.\\nYou need to wake up!\\nI mean, look at yourself.\\nYou are just a scared little kid in a sweat suit.\\nI created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in.\\nI control the truth.\\nMysterio is the truth.\\nIf you were good enough, maybe Tony would still be alive.\\nDeep down, you know I\\'m right.\\nYou made your choice. And all you had to do was step aside.\\nAnd now you have\\nFury.\\nBeck\\'s people are trying to find everyone who could expose him.\\nWho\\'d you tell?\\nI know you told someone, so just tell me.\\nOkay. Who did you tell?\\nWho else did you tell?! Just Ned and MJ from my class.\\nMaybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that\\'s it.\\nWhat?\\nYou are so gullible.\\nWhat?

I shouldn\\'t shout.\\nI just really miss him.\\nYeah, I miss him too.\\nEverywhere I go\\nI see his face.\\nAnd the whole world is asking who\\'s gonna be the next Iron Man\\nand I don\\'t know if that\\'s me, Happy. I\\'m not Iron Man.\\nYou\\'re not Iron Man.\\nYou\\'re never gonna be Iron Man.\\nNobody could live up to Tony.\\nNot even Tony.\\nTony was my best friend.\\nAnd he was a mess.\\nHe second-guessed everything he did. He was all over the place.\\nThe one thing that he did that he didn\\'t second-guess was picking you.\\nI don\\'t think Tony would have done what he did\\nif he didn\\'t know that you were gonna be here after he was gone.\\nNow, your friends are in trouble, you\\'re all alone, your tech is missing.\\nWhat are you gonna do about it?\\nI\\'m gonna kick his ass.\\nBut I mean, right now.

It\\'s the biggest one yet.\\nWhere? London.\\nOkay, the company set up a city tour,\\nand then we\\'ll grab a bite and head to the airport.\\nIs no one else going to acknowledge how crazy this is?\\nOh, yeah, I get it.\\nThere\\'s been nothing scientific about this science tour at all.\\nNo, I\\'m talking about Peter.\\nHas no one noticed how shady he is?\\nBecause I saw him in the back room of a rest stop with some woman\\nin his underwear, and he\\'s always sneaking away,\\nlike back at the opera, huh?\\nNow he\\'s suddenly off the trip, with his family in Berlin?\\nIs no one else interested in the truth?\\n\"The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.\"\\nGeorge Orwell.\\nThank you, MJ. Yeah.\\nWell, since Peter\\'s not really here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?\\nWhy take pictures of people in the bathroom?\\nYeah, what\\'s that about?\\nNo, no, no, it wasn\\'t like that.

Something\\'s definitely up.\\nYou\\'re an FOS now. \"Friend of Spider-Man.\"\\nAnd you have to remember, just stay calm.\\nThat doesn\\'t look good.\\nBut it\\'s fake, there\\'s nothing to worry about.\\nAnd the kids are in the kill zone.\\nGreat work, Guterman.\\nWhat? Happy Hogan here.\\nI know. What do you want? Over at Mr. Stark\\'s,\\ngoing through his belongings.\\nThere was a surfboard you left behind.

You got this. I got this.\\nWalk me through it. I know it\\'s illusion tech.\\nAll I have to do is get inside the illusion, then I can take it down,\\nfind him, and he\\'s just a guy, so I can take EDITH right back.\\nRight, but last time, you got hit by a train.\\nTrue, but this time\\nHow do I explain this? I have a sixth sense.\\nThe Peter-tingle. That\\'s what you\\'re talking about, right?\\nIt\\'s not working, though.\\nI heard it wasn\\'t working right now. Is it? It is working.\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s working So you got the Peter-tingle.\\nThat\\'s the plan. I\\'m gonna go get your friends.\\nYou get that Peter-tingle back online. I got this.\\nCue the lightning. Cuing lightning.\\nSir, is it still safe on the top, or should we all come down?\\nOh, my.\\nWhat did the bus driver say? Bus driver\\'s gone.\\nWhat?!

It looks real to me!\\nFollow me, kids!\\nEarth, wind, fire, water.\\nOh, no. Theyjoined forces like the Power Rangers.\\nYou\\'re thinking of Voltron. Who?\\nVoltron! You\\'re thinking of Voltron!\\nHey, look, it\\'s Mysterio!\\nHe\\'s gonna save us!\\nIf Mysterio knows we know\\nThen we\\'re in danger. Yeah, and so are they.\\nWe should go.\\nKill that witch!\\nThis is for my family!\\nGet somewhere safe, Fury.\\nI don\\'t see this ending well.\\nI appreciate your concern, but I never leave my men behind.\\nAll right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid?\\nI can. It\\'s a little loud out here. I like the new suit.\\nThanks. Whoa, Peter, you sure that\\'s not real?\\nYeah, it\\'s just 100 times bigger than I expected.\\nStill the play?\\nWe need to get high enough so Beck doesn\\'t see me coming.\\nCopy. Stay sticky.\\nHey, Happy. Yeah, kid. What is it?\\nWe need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt!\\nBeck, report!\\nGuterman, I need a response. Something quick and decisive.\\n\"It\\'s all the Elementals. They\\'re merged into something\"\\ninto something else. Something more powerful.\\nIt\\'s drawing energy from the Earth\\'s core.\\nSee, now, that\\'s some bullshit.\\nIs that?\\nBe ready for anything.\\nYeah.\\nIt\\'s not real, it\\'s not real, it\\'s not real!\\nThat\\'s awesome.\\nWilliam, I\\'ve got drones breaking formation.\\nMaybe they hit a flock of birds. You\\'re fine.\\nI wanna see what\\'s happening Taking manual control.\\nDo you see anything?\\nYeah. And I\\'m gonna kill him.\\nI hope this works.\\nYou got me?\\nI got you.\\nBoss, the illusion is coming apart.\\nI see you.\\nEDITH, give me protection. Copy.\\nJust kill the illusion. Kill it.

Illusion almost back up.\\nI don\\'t know how you\\'re gonna spin this.\\nOh, great. No webs.\\nAre we gonna die? Nobody dies on my watch.\\nI wasted my life playing video games, and we\\'re gonna die.\\nI have a fake ID, and I\\'ve never even used it.\\nI post stupid videos daily for people to like me.\\nHey, if it wasn\\'t for those stupid videos,\\nSpider-Man would\\'ve never found you.\\nSpider-Man? Spider-Man follows me? I saved us, guys.\\nIf you saved us, why are we about to die?\\nMJ! Stop it!\\nI\\'m sorry, okay?\\nI\\'m obsessed with telling the truth even if it hurts people\\'s feelings.\\nI\\'m in love with Spider-Man\\'s aunt.\\nWe\\'re sharing, right?\\nYour lies are over, Beck.\\nThis certainly isn\\'t ideal, but I have contingencies.\\nEDITH?\\nJust give me the glasses.\\nYou want these?\\nCome and get them.\\nCome on, Peter-tingle.\\nWhy aren\\'t these drones firing? You\\'re in the strike zone.\\nThe chance of getting hit is No, fire all the drones now!\\nBeck!\\nBeck.\\nYou lied to me.\\nI trusted you. I know.\\nThat\\'s the most\\ndisappointing part.\\nYou\\'re a good person, Peter.\\nSuch a weakness.\\nStark was right.\\nYou do deserve them.\\nYou can\\'t trick me anymore.\\nEDITH, turn off the drones.\\nBiometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter.\\nExecute all cancellation protocols? Just do it.\\nExecute them all. Confirmed.\\nGive me the spear.\\nThat\\'s a halberd.\\nThank you.\\nHow could you do all of this? You\\'ll see, Peter.\\nPeople, they need to believe.\\nAnd nowadays\\nthey\\'ll believe anything.\\nIs he?\\nIs this real?\\nAll illusions are down, Peter.\\nYeah!\\nHey, where you going?\\nMJ. Hey.\\nHey. Hey.\\nAre you okay? I\\'m okay. Are you okay?\\nYeah. Yeah. Is everybody else okay?\\nYeah, everyone\\'s okay.\\nWhat happened? There was just the drones,\\nand they were following us, and then theyjust stopped.\\nWas that you? Yeah.\\nDid you get him?\\nYeah. Well, I\\nbrought that.\\nIn case you needed some help.\\nThanks.\\nAnyway, there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us.\\nI think he works for you or something.\\nHe\\nHe gave me this. No.\\nNo.\\nOh, MJ, I\\'m so sorry.\\nI had this stupid plan. Peter.\\nI wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this and give it to you in Paris at the top\\nAnd you kissed me.\\nWhat? What? Yeah.\\nI don\\'t really have much luck when it comes to getting close to people.\\nSo I lied.\\nI wasn\\'t just watching you because I thought you were Spider-Man.\\nThat\\'s great.\\nBlack dahlia, like the murder. The murder.\\nGood. Yeah.\\nSorry it\\'s broken.\\nI actually like it better broken.\\nI really like you.\\nI really like you too.\\nOkay. I should\\nI should probably get back to the class.\\nI\\'ll go and\\nYeah. I don\\'t know. Okay.\\nJust in case.\\nYeah, no.\\nNo, May, you\\'re right. He did great. He was strong.\\nYeah. I\\'m glad he stayed too.\\nI gotta go.\\nI\\'m glad you\\'re alive. I guess the coded message worked.\\n\"Appearances can be deceiving.\"\\nI\\'m surprised you didn\\'t just wink in the camera.\\nIt worked.\\nOnly because I had serious doubts about Beck from the beginning.\\nNot true. He had zero doubts.\\nWhere\\'s Parker?\\nHe\\'s with a girl.\\nI need to speak with him.\\nHe\\'ll call you. He\\'ll?\\nOkay. Great.\\nWell, he better.\\nOr it\\'s your ass.\\nAnd don\\'t even think about ghosting me.\\nAre you sure no one else has figured it out?\\nYeah, it\\'s not like anybody really pays attention to you.\\nOuch.\\nExcept for me.\\nThanks.\\nDon\\'t be late. I won\\'t.\\nSee you later.\\nYou guys are so cute. Thanks.\\nI was thinking we should all go on a double date or something.\\nOh, we broke up. Oh, we broke up.\\nNo. What? Why?\\nMen and women grow apart,\\nbut the journey they share together will always be a part of them.\\nYou are so wise. Thank you.\\nHello, Gerald.\\nCould Mother not make it?\\nMay! I promise you\\nOh, he\\'s here. Don\\'t give me a ticket.\\nI\\'m so glad you\\'re okay.\\nNo, for real, I\\'m good. I\\'m actually really fine.\\nLet\\'s go. Where are your bags?\\nOh, right. They got blown up. Yeah.\\nI got you some hot buttered bagels. Thank you so much.\\nI know my boy.\\nI kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years.\\nI faced a lot of deception.\\nAnd I\\'m tired of the lies.\\nSo it\\'s time for the truth to be out there.\\nAre you dating?\\nYes. Not really.\\nWhat? Well\\nI think Summer fling.\\nYes, that evolves and grows like any other.\\nI still don\\'t know where it\\'s going to go. Open to wherever it might lead.\\nAnywhere. On or off. To share it with people\\nWe\\'ll always be friends, no matter what. I\\'m gonna go because I\\'ve got a date.\\nbecause we all are interconnected.\\nBye. We are.\\nSorry!\\nHey. Sorry I\\'m late. Hey.\\nIt\\'s fine. You ready?\\nYeah. You\\'re gonna love this.\\nOkay! Okay!\\nOkay. Okay. You ready?\\nYeah. I\\'m just not gonna watch. I\\'m not gonna watch.\\nI should stop looking. I\\'m gonna stop looking!\\nOkay. You can put me down now! You can put me down now!\\nYou okay?\\nYeah. Yeah, I\\'m okay.\\nLet\\'s just Never, never doing that again.\\nI\\'m never doing that again. Okay.\\nI should probably get out of here.\\nBe safe. See you later.\\nThis is breaking news.\\nWe come to you with revelations about last week\\'s attack in London.\\nAn anonymous source provided this video.\\nIt shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, moments before his death.\\nA warning, you may find this video disturbing.\\nI managed to send the Elemental through the rift,\\nbut I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna make it.\\nSpider-Man attacked me for some reason.\\nHe has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology.\\nHe\\'s saying he\\'s the only one who\\'s gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.\\nAre you sure you want to commence the drone attack?\\nThere will be significant casualties. Do it. Execute them all.\\nThis shocking video was released earlier today\\non the controversial news website TheDailyBugle.net.\\nThere you have it, folks, conclusive proof that Spider-Man\\nwas responsible for the murder of Mysterio,\\nan interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet\\nand who will no doubt go down in history\\nas the greatest superhero of all time.\\nBut that\\'s not all, folks.\\nHere\\'s the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves.\\nSpider-Man\\'s real Spider-Man\\'s real name is\\nSpider-Man\\'s name is Peter Parker.\\nWhat the fu?\\nYou gotta tell him.\\nIt was fine.\\nThe little boy handled it.\\nWe helped.\\nTalos. Come off it.\\nHow was I supposed to know that the whole thing was fake?\\nI mean, that was all very convincing.\\nThe performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that.\\nThis is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine.\\nHey there. I hope your mission is going well.\\nWe gave the glasses to Parker about a week ago, like you said.\\nAnd it was very touching, you know?\\nReally, really quite touching.\\nTalos.\\nAnd, you know, shortly after that,\\nit really kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back\\nbecause everyone kept asking where the Avengers are,\\nI don\\'t know what to say to that,\\nso you\\'re lucky that Spider-Man won\\nEverybody back to work!\\nWho\\'s got my shoes?Now, I know what you\\'re thinking.\\n\"Oh, no! Thor\\'s in a cage. How did this happen?\"\\nWell, sometimes you have to get captured\\njust to get a straight answer out of somebody.\\nIt\\'s a long story, but basically, I\\'m a bit of a hero.\\nSee, I spent some time on Earth...\\nFought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.\\nThen I went searching through the cosmos\\nfor some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.\\nDidn\\'t find any.\\nThat\\'s when I came across a path of death and destruction,\\nwhich led me all the way here into this cage,\\nwhere I met you.\\nHow much longer do you think we\\'ll be here?\\nThor, son of Odin.\\nSurtur, son of a bitch.\\nYou\\'re still alive.\\nI thought my father killed you a half a million years ago.\\nI cannot die.\\nNot until I fulfill my destiny\\nand lay waste to your home.\\nIt\\'s funny you should mention that.\\nBecause I\\'ve been having these terrible dreams of late.\\nAsgard up in flames, falling to ruins.\\nAnd you, Surtur, are at the center of all of them.\\nThen you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.\\n- The great prophecy... - Hang on.\\nHang on.\\nI\\'ll be back around shortly.\\nI really feel like we were connecting there.\\nOkay, so Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it.\\nMy time has come.\\nWhen my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame,\\nI shall be restored to my full might.\\nI will tower over the mountains,\\nand bury my sword deep in Asgard\\'s...\\nHang on. Give it a second.\\nI swear, I\\'m not even moving. It\\'s just doing this on its own.\\nI\\'m really sorry.\\nOkay, so let me get this straight.\\nYou\\'re going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame\\nand then you\\'ll suddenly grow as big as a house?\\nA mountain!\\nThe Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?\\nOdin is not on Asgard.\\nAnd your absence has left the throne defenseless.\\nOkay, so where is it? This crown?\\nThis is my crown, the source of my power.\\nOh, that\\'s a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow.\\nIt\\'s a crown.\\nAnyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok\\nis rip that thing off your head.\\nBut Ragnarok has already begun.\\nYou cannot stop it.\\nI am Asgard\\'s doom, and so are you.\\nAll will suffer, all will burn.\\nThat\\'s intense.\\nTo be honest, seeing you grow really big\\nand set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.\\nBut it looks like I\\'m gonna have to choose option B,\\nwhere I bust out of these chains,\\nknock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard\\'s vault.\\nYou cannot stop Ragnarok.\\nWhy fight it?\\nBecause that\\'s what heroes do.\\nWait, I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t time that right.\\nAnd, now!\\nYou have made a grave mistake, Odinson.\\nI make grave mistakes all the time.\\nEverything seems to work out.\\nHeimdall, I know it\\'s been a while, but I could really use a fast exit.\\nHeimdall?\\nHeimdall was an idiot.\\nThis job should have made him rich.\\nNow, the job ain\\'t easy\\nbut it does have its benefits.\\nThe Bifrost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.\\nI mean, it\\'s all mine for the taking.\\nBehold...\\nMy stuff.\\nI\\'m particularly fond of these.\\nI pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.\\nI even named them. Des and Troy.\\nYou see, when you put them together,\\nthey destroy.\\nHeimdall, come on.\\nStay!\\nHeimdall? I\\'m running short on options.\\nHeimdall?\\nSkurge?\\nIs that important?\\nYou girls are in for a treat.\\nGirls!\\nWell, well, well. Look who decided to pop in.\\nThanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains.\\nWho are you?\\nDon\\'t you remember? I\\'m Skurge. We fought together on Vanaheim.\\nRight. Where is Heimdall?\\nThat traitor. No one knows. He\\'s a fugitive of the throne.\\nTraitor?\\nYeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty\\nbut he disappeared before the trial.\\nHard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe.\\nSure.\\nHold on. I\\'m supposed to announce your arrival.\\nWhat the hell is that?\\nOh, brother. This is it.\\nI take my leave.\\nYou fool, you didn\\'t listen!\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nLady Sif, get help!\\nSomebody, help!\\nSorry for all I\\'ve done.\\nIt\\'s all right. Hold on.\\nI\\'m sorry I tried to rule Earth.\\nThey\\'d be lucky to have you.\\nI\\'m sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.\\n- I just couldn\\'t help myself. - I know.\\nI\\'m a trickster.\\nSo mischievous.\\nSorry about that time I turned you into a frog.\\nIt was a wonderful joke.\\n\\'Twas indeed hilarious.\\nYou are the savior of Asgard.\\n- Tell my story. - I will.\\nBuild a statue for me.\\nWe will build a big statue for you.\\nWith my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.\\nI will tell Father what you did here today.\\nI didn\\'t do it for him.\\nI didn\\'t do it for him.\\nNo!\\nAnd so, Loki died of his wounds,\\ngiving his life for ours.\\nHe fought back those disgusting elves,\\nhe brought peace to the realm.\\nLoki, my boy...\\n\\'Twas many moons ago I found you on that frostbitten battlefield.\\nOn that day, I did not yet see in you\\nAsgard\\'s savior. No.\\nYou were merely a little blue baby icicle\\nthat melted this old fool\\'s heart.\\nBravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.\\nFather.\\nShit.\\nMy son, Thor, has returned!\\nGreetings, my boy.\\nIt\\'s an interesting play. What\\'s it called?\\nThe Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.\\nIndeed they should.\\nI like the statue.\\nA lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.\\nA little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.\\nDo you know what this is?\\nThe skull of Surtur. That\\'s a formidable weapon!\\nDo me a favor. Lock this away in a vault\\nso it doesn\\'t turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.\\nThank you, dear.\\nSo it\\'s back to Midgard for you, is it?\\nNope.\\nI\\'ve been having this reoccurring dream lately.\\nEvery night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.\\nThat\\'s just a silly dream,\\nsigns of an overactive imagination.\\nPossibly.\\nBut then I decide to go out there and investigate.\\nAnd what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.\\nEnemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise,\\nall while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms,\\nare sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.\\nYes, it is best to respect our neighbors\\' freedom.\\nYes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.\\nYes, besides I\\'ve been rather busy myself.\\nWatching theater.\\nBoard meetings, and security council meetings...\\n- You\\'re really gonna make me do it? - Do what?\\nYou know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.\\nNot even your face.\\nYou\\'ve gone quite mad. You\\'ll be executed for this.\\nThen I\\'ll see you on the other side, brother.\\nAll right, I yield.\\nBehold!\\nThor...\\n- Odinson. - No.\\nYou had one job. Just the one.\\nWhere\\'s Odin?\\nYou just couldn\\'t stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you.\\nAsgard was prospering. You\\'ve ruined everything.\\n- Ask them. - Where\\'s Father? Did you kill him?\\nYou had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.\\nOkay. I know exactly where he is.\\nI swear I left him right here.\\nRight here on the sidewalk, or right there where the building is being demolished?\\nGreat planning.\\nHow was I supposed to know?\\nCan\\'t see into the future. I\\'m not a witch.\\nNo? Then why do you dress like one?\\n- Hey. - I can\\'t believe you\\'re alive.\\nI saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.\\nI\\'m honored.\\nAsk him.\\nHi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?\\nSure.\\nStart figuring out where he is.\\nOh, my God.\\nSorry to hear that Jane dumped you.\\nShe didn\\'t dump me, you know.\\nI dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.\\nWhat\\'s this? What are you doing?\\nThis isn\\'t me.\\nLoki.\\nThor Odinson.\\nGod of Thunder.\\nYou can put down the umbrella.\\nSo, Earth has wizards now?\\nThe preferred term is \"Master of the Mystic Arts.\"\\nYou can leave that now.\\nAll right, wizard. Who are you? Why should I care?\\nMy name is Doctor Stephen Strange, and I have some questions for you.\\nTake a seat.\\nTea?\\nI don\\'t drink tea.\\nWhat do you drink?\\nNot tea.\\nSo, I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms\\nthat may be a threat to this world.\\nYour adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.\\nHe\\'s a worthy inclusion.\\nThen why bring him here?\\nWe\\'re looking for my father.\\nSo, if I were to tell you where Odin was,\\nall parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?\\nPromptly.\\nGreat! Then I\\'ll help you.\\nIf you knew where he was, why didn\\'t you call me?\\nI have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.\\nYour father said he had chosen to remain in exile.\\nAnd you don\\'t have a phone.\\nNo, I don\\'t have a phone,\\nbut you could have sent an electronic letter. It\\'s called an email.\\n- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?\\nAnyway, my father is no longer in exile.\\nSo if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.\\nGladly. He\\'s in Norway.\\nI\\'m just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.\\nNope.\\nWe don\\'t need that.\\nWill you stop doing that?\\nI need just one strand of your hair.\\nLet me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.\\nWe could have just walked.\\nHe\\'s waiting for you.\\nAll right.\\nDon\\'t forget your umbrella.\\nYes.\\nSorry.\\nThere we go.\\nI suppose I\\'ll need my brother back.\\nYeah. Right.\\nI have been falling for 30 minutes!\\nYou can handle him from here.\\nYes. Of course. Thank you very much for your help.\\nGood luck.\\nHandle me? Who are you?\\nLoki.\\nYou think you\\'re some kind of sorcerer?\\nDon\\'t think for one minute, you second-rate...\\nBye-bye.\\nFather?\\nLook at this place. It\\'s beautiful.\\nFather, it\\'s us.\\nMy sons.\\nI\\'ve been waiting for you.\\nI know. We\\'ve come to take you home.\\nHome, yes.\\nYour mother, she calls me.\\nDo you hear it?\\nLoki, lift your magic.\\nTook me quite a while to break free from your spell.\\nFrigga would have been proud.\\nCome and sit with me. I don\\'t have much time.\\nI know we failed you.\\nBut we can make this right.\\nI failed you.\\nIt is upon us. Ragnarok.\\nNo, I\\'ve stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.\\nNo.\\nIt has already begun. She\\'s coming.\\nMy life was all that held her back. But my time has come.\\nI cannot keep her away any longer.\\nFather, who are you talking about?\\nGoddess of Death. Hela.\\nMy firstborn.\\nYour sister.\\nYour what?\\nHer violent appetites grew beyond my control.\\nI couldn\\'t stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away.\\nShe draws her strength from Asgard,\\nand once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.\\nWhatever she is, we can stop her together. We can face her together.\\nNo, we won\\'t.\\nI\\'m on a different path now.\\nThis you must face alone.\\nI love you, my sons.\\nLook at that.\\nRemember this place.\\nHome.\\nBrother.\\nThis was your doing.\\nSo he\\'s gone.\\nThat\\'s a shame. I would\\'ve liked to have seen that.\\nYou must be Hela.\\nI\\'m Thor, son of Odin.\\nReally? You don\\'t look like him.\\nPerhaps we can come to an arrangement.\\nYou sound like him.\\nKneel.\\nBeg your pardon?\\nKneel.\\nBefore your queen.\\nI don\\'t think so.\\nIt\\'s not possible.\\nDarling, you have no idea what\\'s possible.\\nBring us back!\\nNo!\\nLoki!\\nWho are you? What have you done with Thor?\\nI\\'m Hela.\\nI\\'m just a janitor.\\nYou look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.\\nHow would you like a job?\\nAre you a fighter?\\nOr are you food?\\nI\\'m just passing through.\\nIt is food.\\nOn your knees.\\nHe\\'s mine.\\nWait!\\nWait!\\nHe\\'s mine.\\nSo if you want him, you go through me.\\nBut we\\'ve already got him.\\nAll right, then. I guess I go through you.\\nMore food.\\nThank you.\\nScrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.\\nI\\'ve got something special.\\nHey! Where are you taking me?\\nAnswer me!\\nHey!\\nI am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.\\nMany apologies, your majesty.\\nIt\\'s come to my attention that you don\\'t know who I am.\\nI am Hela, Odin\\'s firstborn,\\nthe commander of the Legions of Asgard,\\nthe rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.\\nMy father is dead.\\nAs are the princes. You\\'re welcome.\\nWe were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.\\nOur supremacy was unchallenged.\\nYet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.\\nOur destiny is to rule over all others.\\nAnd I am here to restore that power.\\nKneel before me\\nand rise into the ranks of my great conquest.\\nWhoever you are,\\nwhatever you\\'ve done, surrender now!\\nOr we will show you no mercy.\\nWhoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?\\nThis is your last warning!\\nI thought you\\'d be happy to see me.\\nFine.\\nCharge!\\nI\\'ve missed this.\\nStill, it\\'s a shame.\\nGood soldiers dying for nothing,\\nall because they couldn\\'t see the future.\\nSad.\\nLook, still alive.\\nChange of heart?\\nGo back to whatever cave you crept out of.\\nYou evil demoness!\\nLet\\'s go see my palace.\\nFear not, for you are found.\\nYou are home, and there is no going back.\\nNo one leaves this place.\\nBut what is this place?\\nThe answer is Sakaar.\\nSurrounded by cosmic gateways,\\nSakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.\\nIt is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.\\nLike you.\\nBut here on Sakaar, you are significant.\\nYou are valuable.\\nHere you are loved.\\nWhat the hell?\\nAnd no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.\\nHe is the original, the first lost and the first found.\\nThe creator of Sakaar,\\nand father of the Contest of Champions.\\nWhere once you were nothing, now you are something.\\nYou are the property of the Grandmaster.\\nCongratulations!\\nYou will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.\\nPrepare yourself.\\nPrepare yourself.\\nYou are now meeting the Grandmaster.\\nHe\\'s wonderful. It is a he?\\nIt is a he.\\nYeah.\\nI love when you come to visit, 142.\\nYou bring me the best stuff.\\nWhenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142,\\nwhat do I always say? \"She is the...\" And it starts with a \"B.\"\\nTrash.\\nNo, not trash.\\nWere you waiting just to call her that? It doesn\\'t start with a \"B.\"\\nBooze hag.\\nI\\'m so sorry. No, \"best.\" I was thinking about \"best.\"\\n\\'Cause I always say you\\'re the best.\\nShe brought me my beloved champion, you know.\\nYou say that every time she\\'s here.\\nWhat have you brought today? Tell me.\\nA contender.\\nA what?\\nI need to go closer. I want to get a closer look at this.\\nCan you take us closer? Thank you.\\nPay this lady.\\nJust wait a damn minute.\\nI\\'m not for sale.\\nMan, he\\'s a fighter.\\nI take 10 million.\\nTell her she\\'s dreaming.\\nFor heaven\\'s sakes, transfer the units.\\nYou\\'ll pay for this.\\nNo, I got paid for this.\\nHere\\'s what I wanna know.\\nWho are you?\\nI am the God of Thunder.\\nI didn\\'t hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that sparkles?\\nWe\\'ve located your cousin.\\nGood!\\nYeah, come on. I think you\\'re gonna like this.\\nThere he is.\\nHey, cuz.\\nWe almost couldn\\'t find you. What, you been hiding?\\nHi.\\nSo...\\nPlease.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nYeah.\\nCarlo...\\nI pardon you.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nYou\\'re officially pardoned. From life.\\nHelp me.\\nOh, my God!\\nI\\'m stepping in it. I\\'m stepping in it. Look!\\nThe smell.\\nWhat does it smell like?\\nBurnt toast.\\nWhat happened to my manners?\\nI haven\\'t properly introduced myself.\\nCome on. Follow me.\\nMy name is Grandmaster.\\nI preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.\\nPeople come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.\\nAnd you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.\\nWhat do you say to that?\\nWe\\'re not friends and I don\\'t give a shit about your games.\\nI\\'m going back to Asgard.\\nAss-gard.\\nOne, two, three, four.\\nThere was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.\\nAt that moment, I let go.\\nLoki?\\nLoki! Loki!\\nOver here. Over here.\\n- Excuse me one second. - Loki!\\n- What? - You\\'re alive?\\n- Yes, of course I\\'m alive. - What are you doing here?\\nWhat do you mean, what am I doing? I\\'m stuck in this stupid chair.\\n- Where\\'s your chair? - I didn\\'t get a chair.\\n- Get me out of this one. Get me out. - I can\\'t.\\n- I can\\'t. - What?\\nI\\'ve made friends with this man. He\\'s called the Grandmaster.\\n- He\\'s crazy! - I\\'ve gained his favor.\\nThe Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.\\n- Weeks ago? - Yes.\\nI just got here.\\nWhat are you whispering about?\\nTime works real different around these parts.\\nOn any other world, I\\'d be, like, millions of years old.\\nBut here on Sakaar...\\nIn any case, you know this...\\nYou call yourself Lord of Thunder?\\nGod of Thunder. Tell him.\\nI\\'ve never met this man in my life.\\n- He\\'s my brother. - Adopted.\\nIs he any kind of a fighter?\\nYou take this thing out of my neck and I\\'ll show you.\\nNow, listen to that. He\\'s threatening me.\\nHey, Sparkles, here\\'s the deal.\\nIf you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...\\nAsgard.\\nAny contender who defeats my champion,\\ntheir freedom they shall win.\\nFine. Then point me in the direction of whoever\\'s ass I have to kick!\\nThat\\'s what I call, contender.\\nDirection would be this way, Lord.\\nLoki!\\nHey. Take it easy, man.\\nOver here.\\nThe pile of rocks waving at you. Here.\\nYeah, I\\'m actually a thing. I\\'m a being.\\nAllow me to introduce myself.\\nMy name is Korg. I\\'m kind of like the leader in here.\\nI\\'m made of rocks, as you can see. But don\\'t let that intimidate you.\\nYou don\\'t need to be afraid unless you\\'re made of scissors.\\nJust a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.\\nThis is my very good friend over here, Miek.\\nHe\\'s an insect and has knives for hands.\\nYou\\'re a Kronan, aren\\'t you?\\n- That I am. - How\\'d you end up in here?\\nWell, I tried to start a revolution, but didn\\'t print enough pamphlets.\\nSo hardly anyone turned up, except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.\\nAs punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.\\nBit of a promotional disaster, that one.\\nBut I\\'m actually organizing another revolution.\\nI don\\'t know if you\\'d be interested in something like that.\\nDo you reckon you\\'d be interested?\\nHow did you...\\nYeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.\\nBut not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.\\n- This doesn\\'t make any sense. - No, nothing makes sense here, man.\\nThe only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense.\\nHas anyone here fought the Grandmaster\\'s champion?\\nDoug has.\\nDoug!\\nOur luck, Doug\\'s dead.\\nThat\\'s right.\\nEveryone who fights the Grandmaster\\'s champion perishes.\\nWhat about you? You\\'re made of rocks.\\nPerishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.\\nYeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot.\\nWait. You\\'re not gonna face him, are you?\\nYes, I am.\\nGonna fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.\\nThat\\'s exactly what Doug used to say.\\nSee you later, new Doug.\\nDoes no one remember me?\\nHas no one been taught our history?\\nLook at these lies.\\nGoblets and garden parties?\\nPeace treaties?\\nOdin...\\nProud to have it,\\nashamed of how he got it.\\nWe were unstoppable.\\nI was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard\\'s empire.\\nOne by one, the realms became ours.\\nBut then, simply because my ambition outgrew his,\\nhe banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.\\nBefore that, Asgard\\'s warriors were honored,\\ntheir bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.\\n- Odin\\'s treasures. - Fake.\\nMost of the stuff in here is fake.\\nOr weak.\\nSmaller than I thought it would be.\\nThat\\'s not bad.\\nBut this...\\nThe Eternal Flame.\\nWant to see what true power really looks like?\\nFenris, my darling, what have they done to you?\\nWith the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.\\nI\\'ve missed you.\\nI\\'ve missed you all.\\nOdin,\\nI bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla,\\nwhere the brave shall live forever.\\nNor shall we mourn but rejoice,\\nfor those that have died the glorious death.\\nHurts, doesn\\'t it?\\nBeing lied to.\\nBeing told you\\'re one thing and then learning it\\'s all a fiction.\\nYou didn\\'t think I\\'d really come and see you, did you?\\nThis place is disgusting.\\nDoes this mean you don\\'t want my help?\\nLook, I couldn\\'t jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.\\nIt took me time to win his trust. He\\'s a lunatic, but he can be amenable.\\nWhat I\\'m telling you is, you could join me at the Grandmaster\\'s side.\\nPerhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...\\nYou\\'re not seriously thinking of going back, are you?\\nOur sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.\\nShe\\'s stronger than both of us. She\\'s stronger than you.\\nYou don\\'t stand a chance.\\nDo you understand what I\\'m saying here?\\nFine.\\nI guess I\\'ll just have to go it alone.\\nLike I\\'ve always done.\\nWould you say something?\\nSay something!\\nWhat would you like me to say?\\nYou faked your own death,\\nyou stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power,\\nstranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.\\nHave I said enough or would you like me to go back further than the past two days?\\nYou know, I haven\\'t seen this beloved champion he talks of,\\nbut I\\'ve heard he is astonishingly savage.\\nI\\'ve placed a large wager against you tomorrow.\\nDon\\'t let me down.\\nPiss off, ghost!\\nHe\\'s freaking gone.\\nYuck!\\nThere\\'s still someone\\'s hair and blood all over this.\\nGuys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?\\nDisgusting slobs.\\nThor,\\nwanna use a big wooden fork?\\nNo.\\nYeah, not really useful.\\nUnless you\\'re fighting off three vampires that were huddled together.\\nI really wish I had my hammer.\\nHammer?\\nQuite unique.\\nIt was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.\\nAnd when I spun it really, really fast, it gave me the ability to fly.\\nYou rode a hammer?\\nNo, I didn\\'t ride the hammer.\\nThe hammer rode you on your back?\\nNo. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the...\\nOh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?\\nThe ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly.\\nEvery time I threw it, it would always come back to me.\\nSounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this hammer\\nand that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.\\nThat\\'s a nice way of putting it.\\nI said they\\'re mine.\\nSee her, that\\'s the one that put me in here.\\nYeah. Scrapper 142.\\nGotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.\\nThey are hard to perish.\\nAsgardian?\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nDo not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.\\nAsgard is in danger.\\nMy God, you\\'re a Valkyrie.\\nI used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger,\\nuntil I found out that you were all women.\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women.\\nSometimes a little too much.\\nNot in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.\\nI think it\\'s great that there is an elite force of women warriors.\\nIt\\'s about time.\\nAre you done?\\nLord of Thunder, you\\'re up.\\nPlease, help me. I need your help.\\nBye.\\nFine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.\\nBecause the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.\\nListen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.\\nAnd I\\'m a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.\\nBring him in for processing.\\nAnd no one escapes this place. So you\\'re gonna die anyway.\\nNow, don\\'t you move.\\nMy hands ain\\'t as steady as they used to be.\\nBy Odin\\'s beard, you shall not cut my hair,\\nlest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.\\nPlease. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.\\nPlease! No!\\nNo!\\nLook at all of you. What a show! What a night!\\nWho\\'s having fun?\\nPlease, I\\'m your host.\\nBig round of applause for all of our undercard competitors,\\nwho today died so gruesomely.\\nGood sports.\\nWhat a show! What a night!\\nThis is what you\\'ve come for, and so have I.\\nAnd now, without further ado,\\nit\\'s main event time.\\nMaking his first appearance, though he looks quite promising,\\ngot a couple of tricks up his sleeve.\\nI\\'ll say no more, see what you think.\\nLadies and gentlemen, I give you...\\nLord of Thunder.\\nWatch out for his fingers. They make sparks.\\nOkay, this is it.\\nLet\\'s get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.\\nHe is a creature.\\nWhat can we say about him?\\nWell, he\\'s unique. There\\'s none like him.\\nI feel a special connection with him.\\nHe\\'s undefeated.\\nHe\\'s the reigning.\\nHe\\'s the defending.\\nLadies and gentlemen...\\nI give you...\\nYour Incredible...\\nHulk!\\nYes!\\nI have to get off this planet.\\nHey, hey, hey. Where you going?\\nHey!\\nWe know each other.\\nHe\\'s a friend from work.\\nWhere have you been?\\nEverybody thought you were dead.\\nBut so much has happened since I last saw you.\\nI lost my hammer.\\nLike, yesterday, so that\\'s still pretty fresh.\\nLoki. Loki\\'s alive. Can you believe it?\\nHe\\'s up there.\\nLoki! Look who it is!\\nBanner, I never thought I would say this,\\nbut I\\'m happy to see you.\\nHulk! Hulk! Hulk!\\nBanner.\\nHey, Banner!\\nNo Banner. Only Hulk.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nIt\\'s me. It\\'s Thor!\\nBanner, we\\'re friends.\\nThis is crazy. I don\\'t want to hurt you!\\nHere we go.\\nWhat?\\nHey, big guy.\\nThe sun\\'s getting real low.\\nThat\\'s it. The sun\\'s going down.\\nI won\\'t hurt you anymore.\\nNo one will.\\nYes!\\nThat\\'s how it feels!\\nI\\'m just a huge fan of the sport.\\nAll right. Screw it.\\nI know you\\'re in there, Banner. I\\'ll get you out!\\nWhat\\'s the matter with you? You\\'re embarrassing me!\\nI told them we were friends!\\nThunder! Thunder! Thunder!\\nThunder! Thunder! Thunder!\\nAnother day, another Doug.\\nWhat is that noise?\\nThe common folk aren\\'t exactly falling in line.\\nThere\\'s a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.\\nTell me about yourself, Skurge.\\nWell, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...\\nRight, yeah, I\\'ll just stop you there. What I meant was,\\nwhat\\'s your ambition?\\nI just want a chance to prove myself.\\nRecognition.\\nWhen I was young,\\nevery great king had an executioner.\\nNot just to execute people,\\nbut also to execute their vision.\\nBut mainly to execute people.\\nStill, it was a great honor.\\nI was Odin\\'s executioner.\\nAnd you shall be my executioner.\\nLet\\'s begin our conquest.\\nSkurge, where\\'s the sword?\\nThat sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.\\nThose people you mentioned, the ones who aren\\'t falling into line...\\nRound them up.\\nExcuse me.\\nSorry about that. These bloody things are everywhere.\\nCome on.\\nYou\\'ll be safe here.\\nAre we cool?\\nIt\\'s Hulk in a hot tub.\\nSo how long have you been like that?\\nLike what?\\nLike this. Big, and green, and stupid.\\nHulk always Hulk.\\nHow\\'d you get here?\\nWinning.\\nYou mean cheating?\\nWere they wearing one of these when you won?\\nHow\\'d you arrive here?\\nQuinjet.\\nYes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?\\nThat\\'s naked.\\nHe\\'s very naked.\\nIt\\'s in my brain now.\\nQuinjet.\\nYes!\\nI\\'m getting us out of here.\\nThis terrible, awful place.\\nYou\\'re gonna love Asgard. It\\'s big. It\\'s golden. Shiny.\\nHulk stay.\\nNo, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.\\nWe must prevent Ragnarok.\\nRagnarok?\\nThe prophesied death of my home world. The end of days, it\\'s the end of...\\nIf you help me get back to Asgard,\\nI can help you get back to Earth.\\nEarth hate Hulk.\\nEarth loves Hulk. They love you.\\nYou\\'re one of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends.\\nThis is what friends do. They support each other.\\nYou\\'re Banner\\'s friend.\\nI\\'m not Banner\\'s friend. I prefer you.\\nBanner\\'s friend.\\nI don\\'t even like Banner.\\n\"I\\'m into numbers and science and stuff.\"\\nThor go. Hulk stay.\\nFine.\\nStay here.\\nStupid place. It\\'s hideous, by the way.\\nThe red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.\\nSmash you.\\nYou didn\\'t smash anything. I won that fight.\\n- I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.\\n- Baby arms. - What?\\nBaby.\\nMoron! You big child.\\nThor go!\\nI am going.\\nThor go again.\\nThor home.\\nHulk trains.\\nThat\\'s great. Have fun.\\n- Hey, big guy. - Angry girl.\\nWhat have you been up to?\\nWinning.\\nHeimdall, I know you can see me.\\nI need you to help me.\\nHelp me see.\\nI see you, but you\\'re far away.\\nWhat\\'s going on here?\\nCome see for yourself.\\nI\\'m providing refuge in a stronghold built by our ancestors.\\nBut if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.\\nYou\\'re talking about evacuating Asgard?\\nWe won\\'t last long if we stay.\\nShe draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger every day.\\nCome on.\\nHela is ravenous.\\nIf I let her leave, she\\'ll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.\\nWe need you.\\nI\\'m working on it. But I don\\'t even know where the hell I am.\\nYou\\'re on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.\\n- Which one? - The big one.\\nThor sad.\\nShut up.\\nThor sad.\\nI\\'m not sad, you idiot.\\nI\\'m pissed off!\\nAngry. I lost my father.\\nI lost my hammer.\\n- Whining and crying. Cry like baby. - You\\'re not even listening.\\nDon\\'t kick stuff.\\nYou\\'re being a really bad friend.\\nYou bad friend!\\n- You know what we call you? - No.\\nWe call you the stupid Avenger.\\nYou\\'re tiny Avenger!\\nWhat, are you crazy?\\nYes.\\nYou know what? Earth does hate you.\\nNo.\\nI\\'m sorry I said those things.\\nYou\\'re not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nYou just can\\'t go around throwing shields at people. Could have killed me.\\nI know. I\\'m sorry. I just get so angry all the time.\\nHulk always, always angry.\\nI know. We\\'re the same, you and I.\\nWe\\'re just a couple of hot-headed fools.\\nYeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.\\nWe\\'re kind of both like fire.\\nBut Hulk like real fire.\\nHulk like raging fire.\\nThor like smoldering fire.\\nHulk, I need you to do something for me.\\nAngry girl.\\nWhat\\'s going on? What are you...\\nYou\\'re so thick-headed that you can\\'t tell\\nwhen someone\\'s hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone?\\n- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.\\nI need her to stay.\\nStay?\\nBlock.\\nStay.\\n- Please. - Please.\\nAll right.\\nHere\\'s the deal.\\nI\\'ll listen to you\\ntill this is empty.\\nAsgard is in danger and people are dying.\\nWe need to get back there.

Only Hulk.\\nIt\\'s me and you.\\nI think it\\'s only you.\\nPlease, listen. The Valkyrie are legend.\\nElite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.\\nI\\'m not getting dragged into another one of Odin\\'s family squabbles.\\n- What\\'s that supposed to mean? - Your sister.\\nHer power comes from Asgard, same as yours.\\nWhen it grew beyond Odin\\'s control she massacred everyone in the palace\\nand tried to seize the throne.\\nWhen she tried to escape her banishment\\nhe sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.\\nI only survived because...\\nLook, I already faced her once back when I believed in the throne,\\nand it cost me everything.\\nThat\\'s what\\'s wrong with Asgard.\\nThe throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.\\nI agree.\\nDon\\'t get familiar.\\nI agree.\\nThat\\'s why I turned down the throne.\\nBut this isn\\'t about the crown. This is about the people.\\nThey\\'re dying and they\\'re your people, too.\\nForget it.\\nI have.\\n- Okay. - Okay.\\n- Good. Great. - Great.\\nThank you.\\n- For what? - For this.\\nDidn\\'t see that, did you?\\nThere... That\\'s better.\\nYou know, go ahead.\\nStay here and enslave people for that lunatic.\\nKeep drinking, keep hiding.\\nBut me...\\nI choose to run toward my problems and not away from them.\\nBecause that\\'s what...\\nBecause that\\'s what heroes do.\\nFriend stay!\\nYes!\\nAll right.\\nCome on.\\nWelcome.

Celebrate my champion.\\nWho\\'s that?\\nHe kind of runs the place.\\nYou actually lived at his house for awhile.\\n- I did? - Yeah.\\nQuite a lot\\'s happened. You and I had a fight recently.\\n- Did I win? - No, I won. Easily.\\nDoesn\\'t sound right.\\nWell, it\\'s true.\\nIt seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.\\nSeductive God of Thunder. We need to move.\\nOh, no.\\nThis is bad.\\nThis is really, really bad.\\nThor, I think I\\'m freaking out.\\nNo, no, no.\\nDon\\'t freak out. You\\'re okay.

Sun\\'s going down.\\nI\\'m upset!\\nI\\'m very upset.\\nYou know what I like about being upset? The blame.\\nRight now, that\\'s the mindset that I\\'m in. And you know who I\\'m blaming?\\n- Grandmaster, I can... - Hey!\\nDon\\'t interrupt me!\\nHere you go.\\nWhy are you handing me the melt stick?\\nHe was interrupting.\\nThat\\'s not a capital violation.\\nWhere was I?\\nMy precious champion has come up missing,\\nand it\\'s all because of that Lord of Thunder. It\\'s all because of him.\\nYour brother.\\nWhatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated, or you know.\\nI\\'m sure there\\'s a big history.\\nAnd your contender...\\nMy dear friend,\\nif you were to give me 12 hours, I could bring them both back to you. Alive.\\nI could do it in two.\\nI could do it in one.\\nLet\\'s stop there.\\nYou know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution.\\nBut for now, I\\'ll settle for this sweet little\\n\"Who\\'s gonna get him first?\"\\nSo, you\\'re on the clock.\\nWhat have you done?\\nI don\\'t answer to you, lackey.\\nIt\\'s Loki.\\nAnd you will answer to the Grandmaster.\\nWhy would you help my brother escape with that green fool?\\nI don\\'t help anyone.\\nYou\\'re a Valkyrie.\\nI thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.\\nChoose your next words wisely.\\nI\\'m terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.\\nThe sun\\'s going down. It\\'s getting really low.\\nThe sun\\'s going down. It\\'s getting real low.\\nOh, shoot.\\n- Sun\\'s getting low. - Would you stop saying that?\\nI just need you to stay calm.\\nCalm? I\\'m on an alien planet!\\nIt\\'s just a planet. You\\'ve been on a planet before.\\nYeah. One.\\nNow you\\'ve been on two. That\\'s a good thing.\\nIt\\'s a new experience.\\nMy neurons, they\\'re firing faster than my brain can handle the information.\\nThe whole thing is totally different this time.\\nIn the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel.\\nBut this time, it\\'s like he had the keys to the car and I was locked in the trunk.\\nAll right, well, you\\'re back now. That\\'s all that matters.\\nNo, it\\'s not what matters.\\nWhat I\\'m trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again,\\nBanner may never come back.\\nAnd we\\'re stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.\\nWe\\'re not stranded. I\\'m gonna figure out a way to get us home.\\nThank you.\\nNot your home, though. Asgard. My home.\\nWhat?\\nListen, my people are in great danger.\\nYou and I, we have to fight this really powerful being,\\nwho also happens to be my sister.\\nOkay, that is so wrong on so many...\\nI don\\'t wanna fight your sister. That\\'s a family issue.\\nNo, she\\'s an evil being.\\nI don\\'t care what she is.\\nI\\'m not fighting any more beings. I\\'m sick of it.\\n- What? - I just told you.\\nIf I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again.\\nAnd you don\\'t care.\\nNo, no. I\\'m putting together the team.\\nThe Hulk is the fire.\\nWait, you\\'re just using me to get to the Hulk.\\n- What? No! - It\\'s gross.\\nYou don\\'t care about me. You\\'re not my friend.\\nNo! I don\\'t even like the Hulk. He\\'s all like...\\n\"Smash, smash, smash.\"\\nI prefer you.\\nThanks.\\nBut if I\\'m being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings,\\nhe is very powerful and useful.\\nYeah, Banner\\'s powerful and useful, too.\\nIs he though?\\nHow many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.\\nHow many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.\\nFine, you don\\'t have to fight anyone.\\nBut we\\'re in danger here, so we have to move.\\nWhat are you doing with that?\\nI need a disguise. I\\'m a fugitive.\\n- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.\\n- I\\'ll be Tony Stark. - What?\\nYeah. Tony and the gypsy.\\nNo, no, you\\'re not Tony. You\\'re Bruce. Bruce Banner.\\nThen why did you dress me up like Tony?\\nBecause you were naked.\\nOkay, I\\'ll give you that.\\nWhat are you doing? Stop doing that!\\nTony wears his pants super tight.\\n- Stop it! - I\\'m sorry.\\n- Why are you being so weird? - I don\\'t know.\\nMaybe the fact that I was trapped for two years\\ninside of a monster made me a little weird.\\nHey. It\\'s okay.\\nYou\\'re good. Calm down. Come on.\\nListen, we\\'re gonna go to Asgard\\nand you\\'re not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?\\nAll right.\\nThis is bad.\\nBanner! Banner!\\nBanner!\\nBanner!\\nThor!\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nI was gonna do that.\\nYeah, well, I did it first.\\nThat\\'s good. What are you doing here?\\nWhat are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.\\nI got sidetracked.\\nWhat\\'s with the...\\nIt\\'s my disguise.\\nBut I can see your face.\\nNot when I do this, you can\\'t.\\nYour hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?\\nWhat are those things on her eyes? Are those people that she\\'s killed?\\nShe\\'s so beautiful and strong and courageous.\\nWho is this guy?\\n- He\\'s a friend. - Who? Me?\\n- I\\'m Bruce. - I feel like I know you.\\nI feel like I know you, too.\\nLook, I\\'ve spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past.\\nSakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget, and to die one day.\\nI was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was gonna kill you.\\nI don\\'t plan to stop drinking.\\nBut I don\\'t wanna forget.\\nI can\\'t turn away anymore,\\nso if I\\'m gonna die,\\nwell, it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag.\\n- Good. - Yeah.\\nSo, I\\'m saying that I wanna be on the team.\\nHas it got a name?\\nYeah, it\\'s called the Revengers.\\nRevengers?\\nBecause I\\'m getting revenge. You\\'re getting revenge.\\nDo you want revenge?\\nI\\'m undecided.\\nOkay.\\nAlso, I\\'ve got a peace offering.\\nSurprise.\\nJust had to be sure.\\nHello, Bruce.\\nSo, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.\\nWhere are you at these days?\\nIt varies from moment to moment.\\nIs that a Dragonfang?\\nIt is.\\nMy God.\\nThis is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.\\nSo, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems.\\nOur best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.\\nRefuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.\\nNope. We are going through the big one.\\nThe Devil\\'s Anus?\\nAnus?\\nWait, wait, wait. Whose anus?\\nFor the record, I didn\\'t know it was called that when I picked it.\\nThat looks like a collapsing neutron star\\ninside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.\\nWe need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.\\nShe\\'s right. We need one that can\\nwithstand the geodetic strain from the singularity.\\nAnd has an offline power steering system\\nthat could also function without the onboard computer.\\nAnd we need one with cup holders, because we\\'re gonna die. So, drinks!\\nDo I know you? I feel like I know you.\\nI feel like I know you, too. It\\'s weird.\\nWhat do you say?\\nUncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway.\\nTalk about an adventure.\\n- We need a ship. - Need a ship.\\nThere are one or two ships. Absolute top of the line models...\\nI don\\'t mean to impose...\\nBut the Grandmaster has a great many ships.\\nI may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.\\nAnd suddenly you\\'re overcome with an urge to do the right thing.\\nHeavens, no.\\nI\\'ve run out of favor with the Grandmaster,\\nand in exchange for codes and access to a ship,\\nI\\'m asking for safe passage through the Anus.\\nYou\\'re telling us that you can get us access into the garage\\nwithout setting off any alarms?\\nYes, brother. I can.\\nOkay, can I just... A quick FYI.\\nI was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago\\nand he was totally ready to kill any of us.\\nHe did try to kill me.\\nYes, me too. On many, many occasions.\\nThere was one time when we were children,\\nhe transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes.\\nSo, I went to pick up the snake to admire it,\\nand he transformed back into himself and he was like, \"Yeah, it\\'s me!\"\\nAnd he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.\\nIf we\\'re boosting a ship\\nwe\\'re gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.\\nWhy not set the beast loose?\\nShut up.\\nYou guys have a beast?\\nNo, there\\'s no beast. He\\'s just being stupid.\\nWe\\'re going to start a revolution.\\n- Revolution? - I\\'ll explain later.\\n- Who\\'s this guy again? - I\\'ll explain later.\\nIs that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that\\'s coming out of you,\\nor are they eggs?\\nLooks like eggs.\\nI\\'m looking for Korg.\\nWho\\'s asking?\\nI know you\\'re asking.\\nIs there anyone else asking, or is it just you?\\nThe Lord of Thunder sends his best.\\nThe revolution has begun.\\nRevolution? How did this happen?\\nDon\\'t know.\\nBut the arena\\'s mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated\\nand the slaves have armed themselves.\\nI don\\'t like that word.\\nWhich? Mainframe?\\nNo. Why would I not like \"mainframe\"?\\nNo, the \"S\" word.\\nSorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.\\nOkay, that\\'s better.\\nHey, so, listen. We should talk.\\nI disagree.\\nOpen communication was never our family\\'s forte.\\nYou have no idea.\\nBeen quite the revelation since we last spoke.\\nHello.\\nHi.\\nOdin brought us together.\\nIt\\'s almost poetic that his death should split us apart.\\nWe might as well be strangers now.\\nTwo sons of the crown, set adrift.\\nThought you didn\\'t wanna talk about it.\\nHere\\'s the thing.\\nI\\'m probably better off staying here on Sakaar.\\nThat\\'s exactly what I was thinking.\\nDid you just agree with me?\\nCome on, this place is perfect for you.\\nIt\\'s savage, chaotic, lawless...\\nBrother, you\\'re gonna do great here.\\nDo you truly think so little of me?\\nLoki, I thought the world of you.\\nI thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.\\nBut at the end of the day, you\\'re you and I\\'m me.\\nI don\\'t know, maybe there\\'s still good in you.\\nBut let\\'s be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.\\nYeah.\\nIt\\'s probably for the best that we never see each other again.\\nIt\\'s what you always wanted.\\nHey, let\\'s do \"Get Help.\"\\n- What? - \"Get Help.\"\\nNo.\\n- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.\\n- It\\'s great. It works every time. - It\\'s humiliating.\\n- Do you have a better plan? - No.\\nWe\\'re doing it.\\nWe are not doing \"Get Help.\"\\nGet help! Please!\\nMy brother, he\\'s dying.\\nGet help! Help him!\\nClassic.\\nStill hate it.\\n- It\\'s humiliating. - Not for me, it\\'s not.\\nNow, which one\\'s the ship she told us to get?\\nThe Commodore.\\nRight.\\nThough I feel it won\\'t make much of a difference.\\nLoki.\\nI know I\\'ve betrayed you many times before,\\nbut this time it\\'s truly nothing personal.\\nThe reward for your capture will set me up nicely.\\nNever one for sentiment, were you?\\nEasier to let it burn.\\nI agree.\\nThat looks painful.\\nDear brother, you\\'re becoming predictable.\\nI trust you, you betray me.\\nRound and round in circles we go.\\nSee, Loki, life is about... It\\'s about growth.\\nIt\\'s about change.\\nBut you seem to just wanna stay the same.\\nI guess what I\\'m trying to say\\nis that you\\'ll always be the God of Mischief,\\nbut you could be more.\\nI\\'ll just put this over here for you.\\nAnyway, all got places to be, so good luck.\\nAll right, I can figure this out.\\nIt\\'s just another spaceship.\\nLoyal Sakaarians,\\nLord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.\\nSakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.\\nDo not let him leave this planet.\\n- Good shot! - Thanks.\\nOpen the doors.\\nOkay.\\nI hope that you\\'re tougher than you look.\\nWhy?\\nShouldn\\'t we be shooting back or something?\\nYes, we should.\\nWhere are the guns on this ship?\\nThere aren\\'t any.\\n- It\\'s a leisure vessel. - What?\\nGrandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.\\nDid she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?\\nYeah.\\nDon\\'t touch anything.\\nNo!\\n- No! - No!\\nGet inside!\\nIn a minute.\\nI should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.\\nNo. I don\\'t know how to fly one of these.\\nYou\\'re a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.\\nNone of them are for flying alien spaceships!\\nOkay, come on.\\nThere\\'s gotta be a gun on this thing.\\nThat looks like a gun.\\nIt\\'s my birthday It\\'s my birthday\\nIt\\'s my birthday\\nYeah!\\nGuys, we\\'re coming up on the Devil\\'s Anus!\\nThere she is.\\nOur ticket out of here.\\nHey, what\\'s this?\\nThank you.\\nHey, man. We\\'re about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.\\nYou wanna come?\\nYou do seem like you\\'re in desperate need of leadership.\\nWhy, thank you.\\nHere we go.\\nShit.\\nAsgardians...\\nSome misguided soul\\nhas stolen the Bifrost sword.\\nTell us where it is\\nor there will be consequences.\\nBad ones.\\nWell?\\nYou.\\nWell? Executioner?\\nWait!\\nWait!\\nI know where the sword is.\\nI never thought I\\'d be back here.\\nI thought it\\'d be a lot nicer.\\nI mean, not that it\\'s not nice. It\\'s just, it\\'s on fire.\\nHere, up here in the mountains.\\nHeat signatures. People clustered together.\\nShe\\'s coming for them.\\nOkay, drop me off at the palace and I\\'ll draw her away.\\nAnd get yourself killed?\\nThe people trapped down there are all that matters.\\nWhile I\\'m dealing with Hela, I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.\\nHow the hell are we supposed to do that?\\nI have a man on the ground.\\nAsgard.\\nShe\\'s here.\\nNow the ship has a gun.\\nI\\'ll take it from here.\\nI found this in the armory.\\nGood luck.\\nYour Majesty...\\nDon\\'t die.\\nYou know what I mean.\\nWe must keep moving!\\nGo to the Bifrost!\\nSister.\\nYou\\'re still alive.\\nI love what you\\'ve done with the place. Redecorating, I see.\\nIt seems our father\\'s solution to every problem was to cover it up.\\nOr to cast it out.\\nHe told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.\\nYou see?\\nYou never knew him.\\nNot at his best.\\nOdin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.\\nWhere do you think all this gold came from?\\nAnd then, one day,\\nhe decided to become a benevolent king.\\nTo foster peace, to protect life.\\nTo have you.\\nI understand why you\\'re angry.\\nAnd you are my sister, and technically have a claim to the throne.\\nAnd believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.\\nBut it can\\'t be you.\\nYou\\'re just the worst.\\nOkay, get up.\\nYou\\'re in my seat.\\nYou know, Father once told me\\nthat a wise king never seeks out war.\\nBut must always be ready for it.\\nGo back!\\nGo!\\nTo be honest, I expected more.\\nHeimdall!\\nThe sword!\\nHere\\'s the difference between us.\\nI\\'m Odin\\'s firstborn,\\nthe rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.\\nAnd you\\'re nothing.\\nSo simple, even a blind man could see it.\\nNow you remind me of Dad.\\nThe stupid dog won\\'t die!\\nEverything\\'s gonna be all right now. I got this.\\nYou wanted to know who I am?\\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\\nYou\\'ll see!\\nYou see? No one\\'s going anywhere.\\nI\\'ll get that sword,\\neven if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.\\nHey, man.\\nI\\'m Korg. This is Miek.\\nWe\\'re gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Wanna come?\\nYour savior is here.\\nDid you miss me?\\nEveryone, on that ship now.\\nWelcome home. I saw you coming.\\nOf course you did.\\nIt\\'s a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.\\nYou see...\\nI\\'m not a queen or a monster.\\nI\\'m the Goddess of Death.\\nWhat were you the god of, again?\\nEven when you had two eyes,\\nyou\\'d see only half the picture.\\nShe\\'s too strong. Without my hammer, I can\\'t.\\nAre you Thor, the God of Hammers?\\nThat hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it.\\nIt was never your source of strength.\\nIt\\'s too late. She\\'s already taken Asgard.\\nAsgard is not a place. Never was.\\nThis could be Asgard.\\nAsgard is where our people stand.\\nEven now, right now, those people need your help.\\nI\\'m not as strong as you.\\nNo...\\nYou\\'re stronger.\\nTell me, brother.\\nWhat were you the god of, again?\\n- You\\'re late. - You\\'re missing an eye.\\nThis isn\\'t over.\\nI think we should disband the Revengers.\\nHit her with a lightning blast.\\nI just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.\\nIt did nothing.\\nWe just need to hold her off until everyone\\'s on board.\\nIt won\\'t end there.\\nThe longer Hela\\'s on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.\\nShe\\'ll hunt us down.\\nWe need to stop her here and now.\\nSo what do we do?\\nI\\'m not doing \"Get Help.\"\\nAsgard\\'s not a place, it\\'s a people.\\nLoki,\\nthis was never about stopping Ragnarok.\\nThis was about causing Ragnarok.\\nSurtur\\'s crown, the vault.\\nIt\\'s the only way.\\nBold move, brother.\\nEven for me.\\nShall we?\\nAfter you.\\nThis is madness.\\nGo! Go, now!\\nFor Asgard.\\nHela!\\nWith the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.\\nHela, enough!\\nYou want Asgard, it\\'s yours.\\nWhatever game you\\'re playing, it won\\'t work.\\nYou can\\'t defeat me.\\nNo, I know.\\nBut he can.\\nNo.\\nTremble before me, Asgard!\\nI am your reckoning!\\nThe people are safe.\\nThat\\'s all that matters.\\nWe\\'re fulfilling the prophecy.\\nI hate this prophecy.\\nSo do I, but we have no choice.\\nSurtur destroys Asgard,\\nhe destroys Hela, so that our people may live.\\nBut we need to let him finish the job, otherwise...\\nNo!\\nHulk, stop, you moron!\\nHulk, stop.\\nJust for once in your life, don\\'t smash.\\nBig monster!\\nLet\\'s go!\\nFine.\\nI am Asgard\\'s doom!\\nThe damage is not too bad.\\nAs long as the foundations are still strong,\\nwe can rebuild this place.\\nIt will become a haven\\nfor all peoples and aliens of the universe.\\nNow those foundations are gone. Sorry.\\nWhat have I done?\\nYou saved us from extinction.\\nAsgard is not a place...\\nIt\\'s a people.\\nIt suits you.\\nMaybe you\\'re not so bad after all, brother.\\nMaybe not.\\nThank you.\\nIf you were here, I might even give you a hug.\\nI\\'m here.\\nYour throne.\\nSo, King of Asgard.\\nWhere to?\\nI\\'m not sure.\\nAny suggestions?\\nMiek, where are you from?\\nMiek\\'s dead.\\nYeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.\\nI\\'ve just felt so guilty, I\\'ve been carrying him around all day.\\nMiek, you\\'re alive!\\nHe\\'s alive, guys. What was your question again, bro?\\nEarth it is.\\nDo you really think it\\'s a good idea to go back to Earth?\\nYes, of course. The people of Earth love me. I\\'m very popular.\\nLet me rephrase that.\\nDo you really think it\\'s a good idea to bring me back to Earth?\\nProbably not, to be honest.\\nI wouldn\\'t worry, brother. I feel like everything\\'s gonna work out fine.\\nOh, boy.\\nI just gotta say, I\\'m proud of you all.\\nThis revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!\\nPat on the back. Pat on the back.\\nCome on. No?\\nMe too. \\'Cause I\\'ve been a big part of it.\\nCan\\'t have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.\\nSo, you\\'re welcome.\\nAnd it\\'s a tie.Stark!\\nHe doesn\\'t seem happy.\\nHello, Hank.\\nYou\\'re supposed to be in Moscow.\\nI took a detour...\\nThrough your defense lab.\\nTell me that isn\\'t what I think it is.\\nThat depends if you think it\\'s a poor attempt to replicate my work.\\nEven for this group, that takes nerve.\\nYou were instructed to go to Russia.\\nMay I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you\\'re a soldier...\\nI\\'m a scientist.\\nThen act like one.\\nThe Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed.\\nHelp us put it to good use.\\nI let you turn me into your errand boy,\\nand now you try to steal my research?\\nIf only you\\'d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.\\nAh...\\nEasy, Hank.\\nYou mention my wife again\\nand I\\'ll show you ferocity.\\nDon\\'t look at me. You said it.\\nI formally tender my resignation.\\nWe don\\'t accept it. Formally.\\nHank,\\nwe need you.\\nThe Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.\\nDon\\'t let your past determine the future.\\nAs long as I am alive,\\nnobody will ever get that formula.\\nWe shouldn\\'t let him leave the building.\\nYou\\'ve already lied to him. Now you want to go to war with him?\\nYes.\\nOur scientists haven\\'t come close to replicating his work.\\nHe just kicked your ass, full-size.\\nYou really want to find out what it\\'s like when you can\\'t see him coming?\\nI\\'ve known Hank Pym for a long time.\\nHe\\'s no security risk.\\nUnless we make him one.\\nYou like that?\\nYou like that?\\nCome get you some now.\\nYou didn\\'t even move.\\nNah.\\nWhat if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here.\\nYou see this right here?\\nI\\'m gonna miss you, Scott.\\nI\\'m gonna miss you, too, Peachy.\\nMan, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.\\nAll right, break it up.\\nBreak it up! Break it up!\\nScotty!\\nWhat\\'s up, man!\\nDamn! Hey.\\nHa-ha! Hey, man.\\nHey, what\\'s up with your eye?\\nOh. Well, what do you think? Peachy. It\\'s a going-away present.\\nOh, yeah. I still got my scar from a year ago.\\n- Oh, yeah. - Yeah.\\nYou know what?

I needed a place to stay.\\nYou wait till you see this couch. You\\'re gonna be really happy.\\nYou\\'re gonna be on your feet in no time. Watch.\\n- I hope so. - Yeah.\\nAnd I gotta introduce you to some people. Some really skilled people.\\n- Not interested. - Yeah, right.\\nNo, I\\'m serious, man. I\\'m not going back.\\nI got a daughter to take care of.\\nYou know that jobs don\\'t come easy for ex-cons, right?\\nLook, man, I got a master\\'s in electrical engineering, all right?\\nI\\'m gonna be fine.\\nWelcome to Baskin-Robbins.\\nWould you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?\\nUh, no, thanks.\\nUm, I will have...

Thanks.\\n- Hey, Dale. - Come on in.\\nPull up some chair.\\nThree years at San Quentin, huh?\\nYou found out.\\nBaskin-Robbins always finds out.\\nLook, I\\'m sorry, all right? But I...\\nNo one would hire me.\\nBreaking and entering. Grand larceny.\\nLook, I\\'m sorry.\\nI don\\'t do it anymore. I just...\\nRespect.\\nI couldn\\'t be happier about it.\\n- Really? - Yeah.\\nThank you. Thank you.\\nYou really stuck it to those billionaire SOBs.\\nThe more I read about what you did and stuff...\\nI\\'m like, \"Wow, I know this guy?\\n\"I\\'m in charge of this guy?\"\\nWell, I\\'m very happy in this job,\\nand I really just appreciate the opportunity to...\\nWell, you\\'re fired, of course.\\nI can\\'t really keep you on.\\nWait, what? Fired?\\nYeah.\\nDale, look, it wasn\\'t a violent crime. I mean, I\\'m a good worker.\\nNo, it wasn\\'t a violent crime. It was a cool crime.\\nI\\'ll tell you what, though.\\nThis will be totally off the books, off the records,\\nbut if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts\\non your way out the door,\\nI\\'ll just pretend I didn\\'t see it.\\nHey, Scotty.

Nice to meet you, too.\\nWho are you?\\nDave.\\nNice work on the Vista job.\\nVista job, yes.\\nNo, no. I have heard of this robbery.\\nWell, technically, I didn\\'t rob them. Robbery involves threat.\\nI hate violence. I burgled them. I\\'m a cat burglar.\\nYou mean you\\'re a pussy.\\nYeah.\\nThey were overcharging the customers, right?\\nAnd it added up to millions.\\nHe blows the whistle and he gets fired.\\nAnd what does he do?\\nHe hacks into the security system\\nand transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.\\nPosts all the bank records online.\\nAnd he drove the dude\\'s Bentley into his swimming pool.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nHmm?\\nWhy are you telling my life story to these guys?\\nWhat do you want?\\nOkay.\\nMy cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago\\n- about this little perfect job. - No way.\\nNo, no, no.

Won\\'t he, Hope?\\nWe\\'re ready for you inside.\\nOuch.\\nI guess some old wounds never heal, huh?\\nDon\\'t worry, she\\'s in good hands.\\nYou\\'re in for a treat.\\nLong time, no see, Dr. Pym. How\\'s retirement?\\nHow\\'s your face?\\nAfter you.\\nNow, before we start, I\\'d like to introduce a very special guest.\\nThis company\\'s founder and my mentor,\\nDr. Hank Pym.\\nWhen I took over this company for Dr. Pym,\\nI immediately started researching a particle\\nthat could change the distance between atoms,\\nwhile increasing density and strength.\\nWhy this revolutionary idea remained buried\\nbeneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank\\'s research, I couldn\\'t tell you.\\nBut just imagine,\\na soldier the size of an insect.\\nThe ultimate secret weapon.\\nAn Ant-Man.\\nThat\\'s what they called you. Right, Hank?\\nSilly, I know.\\nPropaganda.\\nTales to astonish!\\nTrumped-up BS to scare the USSR.\\nHank, will you tell our guests what you told me\\nevery single time I asked you,\\n\"Was the Ant-Man real?\"\\nJust a tall tale.\\nRight.\\nBecause how could anything so miraculous possibly be real?\\nWell, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.\\nAnd with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material,\\nI thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?\\nCould that be done?\\nWell, it\\'s not a legend anymore.\\nDistinguished guests,\\nI am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it.\\nThe Yellowjacket!\\nOh, no.\\nThe Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war\\ncapable of altering the size of the wearer\\nfor the ultimate combat advantage.\\nWe live in an era\\nin which the weapons we use to protect ourselves\\nare undermined by constant surveillance.\\nIt\\'s time to return to a simpler age.\\nOne where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly\\nto protect their interests.\\nAn all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,\\nThe Yellowjacket can manage any conflict\\non the geopolitical landscape\\ncompletely unseen.\\nEfficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault.\\nPractical applications include surveillance,\\nindustrial sabotage,\\nand the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace.\\nA single Yellowjacket\\noffers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions.\\nAnd, one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets\\nwill create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world.\\nThe Yellowjacket.\\nSo, it\\'s a suit?\\nDon\\'t be crude, Frank.\\nIt\\'s not a suit, it\\'s a vessel.\\nWhat\\'s the matter? You\\'re not impressed?\\nNo, I\\'m impressed. I\\'m also concerned.\\nImagine what our enemies could do with this tech.\\nWe should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.\\nI really value your opinion.\\nThank you for coming. Hope?\\nThank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now.\\nThank you.\\nYou seem a bit shocked.\\nDarren, there\\'s a reason that I buried these secrets.\\nSo you finally admit it!\\nWe could have done this together, Hank. But you ruined that.\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re the past and I\\'m the future.\\nDon\\'t do this.\\nDr. Cross?\\nYou sell to me first, 20% over your asking price,\\nI can have the cash here in two weeks.\\nDeal.\\nWe have to make our move, Hank.\\nHow close is he?\\nHe still can\\'t shrink a live subject.\\nJust give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.\\nNo.\\nI have Cross\\' complete trust.\\n- It\\'s too dangerous. - We don\\'t have a choice.\\nWell, that\\'s not entirely true.\\nI think I found a guy.\\nWho?\\nDaddy!\\nPeanut! Oh!\\nHappy birthday!\\nI\\'m so sorry I\\'m late.\\nI didn\\'t know what time your party started.\\nIt was on the invitation.\\nHe didn\\'t get an invitation.\\nBut he came anyway!\\nWell, I\\'m not gonna miss my little girl\\'s birthday party.\\nI\\'m gonna go tell Mommy you\\'re here.\\nOh, you don\\'t...\\nWhat are you doing here, Lang?\\nYou haven\\'t paid a dime of child support.\\nYou know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.\\nIt\\'s good to see you too, Paxton.\\nMommy\\'s so happy you\\'re here, she choked on her drink.\\nHey, look what I have for you.\\nCan I open it now?\\nOf course, sweetheart. It\\'s your birthday.\\nYou\\'re my bestest friend.\\nWhat is that thing?\\nHe\\'s so ugly!\\nI love him!\\nCan I go show my friends?\\nOf course, sweetheart. Go ahead.\\nYou\\'re my bestest friend.\\nLook, the child support is coming, all right?\\nIt\\'s just hard finding a job when you have a record.\\nI\\'m sure you\\'ll figure it out. But for now, I want you out of my house.\\n- No way! It\\'s my daughter\\'s birthday. - It\\'s my house!\\n- So what? It\\'s my kid! - Scott!\\nYou can\\'t just show up here. You know that. Come on.\\nIt\\'s a birthday party.\\nYeah, I know, but you can\\'t just show up.\\nShe\\'s my daughter.\\nYou don\\'t know the first thing about being a father.\\nMaggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life.\\nYour fiancé is an asshat.\\nHe\\'s not an asshat.\\n- Hey, watch your language. Okay? - What language? I said \"hat.\"\\nStop it.\\nReally, Maggie? That guy?\\nCome on! You could marry anyone you want,\\nand you have to get engaged to a cop?\\nAt least he\\'s not a crook.\\nI\\'m trying, okay? I\\'ve changed. I\\'m straight.\\nI had a job and...\\nI wanna provide.\\nI had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.\\nSo much.\\nI\\'ve missed so much time and I wanna be a part of her life.\\nWhat do I do?\\nGet an apartment,\\nget a job, pay child support.\\nAnd then we will talk about visitation, I promise.\\nYou\\'re her hero, Scott.\\nJust be the person that she already thinks you are.\\nI\\'m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.\\nYeah. Well, uh...\\nUnfortunately, we can\\'t just do whatever we want.\\nIt\\'d be nice though, right?\\nBut there are laws.\\nWhat laws? Of man?\\nThe laws of nature transcend the laws of man.\\nAnd I\\'ve transcended the laws of nature.\\nDarren, I don\\'t think you understand...\\nHmm.\\nWe still haven\\'t worked out all the bugs.\\nGoodbye, Frank.\\nThank you.\\nYou know, I\\'ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.\\nAnd today, during my morning meditation,\\nan interesting thought occurred to me, and I think it might apply to you, too.\\nHow\\'s that?\\nGratitude can be forgiveness.\\nI\\'ve spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.\\nI devoted my genius to him.\\nI could have worked anywhere.\\nI chose my mentor poorly.\\nYou didn\\'t even have a choice.\\nHe never believed in you.\\nIt\\'s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn\\'t he?\\nBut we shouldn\\'t be angry, we should be grateful.\\nBecause his failures as a mentor,\\nas a father,\\nforced us to spread our wings.\\nYou\\'re a success, Darren.\\nYou deserve everything coming your way.\\nOoh.\\nStop cheating.\\nHey, what\\'s up, hotshot?\\nMaybe he didn\\'t hear you.\\nHow was the party?\\n- Tell me about that tip. - What?\\nI wanna know about that tip.\\nOh, baby, it\\'s on! It\\'s so on, right now.\\nCalm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from.\\nIt\\'s gotta be airtight.\\nOkay.\\nI was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto.\\nWhich was mainly reds, and you know I don\\'t like reds, man.\\nBut there was a rosé that saved the day. It was delightful.\\nAnd then he tells me about this girl, Emily, that we used to kick it with.\\nIt was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched.\\nIt\\'s the wrong details.\\nIt has nothing to do with the story.\\nGo.\\nSo, uh, he tells me that she\\'s working as a housekeeper now, right?\\nAnd she\\'s dating this dude, Carlos, who\\'s a shot caller from across the bay.\\nAnd she tells him about the dude that she\\'s cleaning for.\\nRight? That he\\'s like this big-shot CEO\\nThat is all retired now, but he\\'s loaded.\\nAnd so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team,\\nand they get to talking, right?\\nAnd here comes the good part. Carlos says, \"Yo, man.\\n\"This guy\\'s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chilling.\"\\nOf course Ernesto comes to me because he knows I got mad thieving skills.\\nOf course, I ask him...\\n\"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was?\"\\nAnd he says, \"Nah, dawg.\\n\"All she said is that it\\'s super-legit\\n\"and whatever\\'s in it, it\\'s gotta be good.\"\\nWhat?\\nOld man have safe.\\nAnd he\\'s gone for a week.\\nAll right. There\\'s an old man, he\\'s got a safe,\\nand he\\'s gone for a week.\\nLet\\'s just work with that.\\nYou know what I\\'m saying?\\nLandline\\'s cut, cell signal\\'s jammed.\\nNo one will be making for distress call tonight.\\nComm check.\\n- Check. - Check.\\nHey, if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?\\nDon\\'t worry.\\nIt\\'s not gonna happen.\\nI love it when he gets cocky.\\nDamn!\\nAlarm is dead.\\nNice.\\nAll right, I\\'m moving through the house.\\nThere\\'s a fingerprint lock on the door.\\nIt\\'s got what? Ernesto didn\\'t tell me nothing about that.\\nAw, man, are we screwed?\\nNot necessarily.\\nI\\'m in.\\nNo alarms have been triggered. He\\'s in like the Flynn.\\nOh, man.\\nWhat is it?\\nWell, they weren\\'t kidding. This safe is serious.\\nHow serious are we talking, Scotty?\\nIt\\'s a Carbondale.\\nIt\\'s from 1910.\\nMade from the same steel as the Titanic.\\nWow.\\nCan you crack it?\\nWell, here\\'s the thing. It doesn\\'t do so well in the cold.\\nRemember what that iceberg did?\\nYeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.\\nKilled everybody.\\nDid not kill the Old lady.\\nShe still throw the jewel into the oceans.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.\\nIce expands. Metal doesn\\'t.\\n- What are you doing now? - Waiting.\\nWaiting.\\nNice.\\nWhat is it? Cash? Jewels?\\n- There\\'s nothing here. - What did you say?\\n- It\\'s a suit. - What?\\nIt\\'s an old motorcycle suit.\\nThere\\'s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?\\nNo.\\nIt\\'s a bust.\\nI\\'m really sorry, Scotty.\\nI know you needed to score.\\nI thought we were using mice.\\nWhat\\'s the difference?\\nCommence Experiment 34-C. Organic atomic reduction.\\nDarren, maybe we should think...\\nShrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology.\\nI can\\'t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.\\nExperiment 34-C results,\\nnegative.\\nSanitize the work station. Bring in subject 35-C.\\nWhy would you lock this up?\\nThis is so weird.\\nScotty, what\\'s up, man?\\nI wonder... What is this?\\nThe world sure seems different from down here, doesn\\'t it, Scott?\\nWhat? Who said that?\\nLuis, down here!\\nIt\\'s a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,\\nwater.\\nGuess you\\'re tougher than you thought.\\nOh, I don\\'t want to see this!\\nLuis!\\nSon of a...\\nWhat the hell?\\nNot bad for a test drive.\\nKeep the suit. I\\'ll be in touch.\\nNo! No! No, thank you!\\nGet down on the ground!\\nYou are under arrest!\\nNo, I didn\\'t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.\\nOh...\\nDon\\'t move.\\nYou know, you almost had us convinced\\nthat you were gonna change your ways.\\nThey were really rooting for you.\\nIt\\'s gonna break their hearts.\\n- You got a visitor. - Who?\\nYour lawyer.\\nMy lawyer?\\nI told you I\\'d be in touch, Scott.\\nI\\'m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.\\nOh, man.\\nSit down.\\nSir, I\\'m sorry I stole the suit.\\nI don\\'t even wanna know why you have it.\\nMaggie was right about you.\\nHow do you know about...\\nNo wonder she\\'s trying to keep you away from Cassie.\\nThe moment things get hard,\\nyou turn right back to crime.\\nThe way I see it, you have a choice.\\nYou can either spend the rest of your life in prison,\\nor go back to your cell\\nand await further instructions.\\nI don\\'t understand.\\nNo, I don\\'t expect you to.\\nBut you don\\'t have many options right now, and quite frankly,\\nneither do I.\\nWhy do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?\\nWhat?\\nSecond chances don\\'t come around all that much.\\nSo, next time you think you might see one,\\nI suggest you take a real close look at it.\\nYou\\'re my bestest friend!\\nAre you sure you don\\'t want a different toy?\\nNo, I love this one.\\nOkay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.\\n- Mommy? - Hmm?\\nIs Daddy a bad man?\\nI heard some grownups say he\\'s bad.\\nNo.\\nDaddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?\\nSmart choice. You actually listened, for once.\\nUnder the door.\\nOkay, where to now?\\n- Hang tight. - Oh, God.\\nWhat, what?\\nWhere the hell did he go?\\nI have no idea. He just vanished.\\nSet up a five-block perimeter. Now!\\nGet back! Get back!\\nScott, these are my associates.\\nIs that a camera on an ant?\\nYeah, sure. Why not?\\nWhere\\'s the car?\\nNo car. We\\'ve got wings.\\nIncoming!\\nPut your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.\\n- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!\\nWhy am I on a police car? Shouldn\\'t I not be on a police car?\\nSo they can give you a lift past their five-block perimeter.\\nAll right.\\n- Now, what\\'s the next move? - Hang on tight.\\nOh, this is easy! I\\'m getting the hang of this.\\nYank up to go up. It\\'s like a horse.\\nYou\\'re throwing 247 off balance.\\nWait, his name is 247?\\nHe doesn\\'t have a name, he has a number, Scott.\\nDo you have any idea how many ants there are?\\nWhoa!\\nMaybe it\\'s... Maybe it\\'s 248.\\nNo, no! Vertigo, vertigo!\\n- No, I think it\\'s 247. - Wait.\\nHang on tight!\\nI think I\\'m getting the hang of this.\\nI am controlling 247. He is not listening to you.\\nWhat?\\n- Can I make one little request? - No.\\nStop, 247! Time out, time out.\\nTime out.\\nAll right, hold on.\\nJust wait! Whoa!\\nWhat happens if I throw up in this helmet?\\nIt\\'s my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.\\nLet\\'s set her down, all right?\\nI\\'m getting light-headed.\\nHang on, Scott.\\nI\\'m getting a little light...\\nI need a snooze button.\\nHit me in 5 minutes.\\nHello.\\nWho are you?\\nHave you been standing there, watching me sleep, this whole time?\\nYes.\\nWhy?\\nBecause the last time you were here, you stole something.\\nOh. Oh.\\nHey, look...\\nWhoa!\\nParaponera clavata.\\nGiant tropical bullet ants,\\nranked highest on the Schmidt pain index.\\nThey\\'re here to keep an eye on you when I can\\'t.\\nDr. Pym\\'s waiting for you downstairs.\\nWho?\\nHey!\\nUm... Whose pajamas are these?\\nHow am I supposed to do this?\\nAll right, just one step at a time.\\nUgh!\\nYou don\\'t bite me, I don\\'t step on you. Deal?\\nI could take down the servers and Cross wouldn\\'t even know it.\\nWe don\\'t need this guy.\\nI assume that you\\'ve already met my daughter, Hope.\\nI did. She\\'s great.\\nShe doesn\\'t think that we need you.\\nWe don\\'t. We can do this ourselves.\\nI go to all this effort to let you steal my suit,\\nand then Hope has you arrested.\\nOkay, we can try this and when he fails, I\\'ll do it myself.\\nShe\\'s a little bit anxious.\\nIt has to do with this job,\\nwhich, judging by the fact that you\\'re sitting opposite me,\\nI take it that you\\'re interested in.\\nWhat job?\\nWould you like some tea?\\nUh... Sure.\\nI was very impressed with\\nhow you managed to get past my security system.\\nFreezing that metal was particularly clever.\\nWere you watching me?\\nScott, I\\'ve been watching you for a while.\\nEver since you robbed Vista Corp.\\nOh! Excuse me.\\n\"Burgled\" Vista Corp.\\nVista\\'s security system was one of the most advanced in the business.\\nIt was supposed to be unbeatable.\\nBut you beat it.\\nWould you like some sugar?\\nYeah, thanks.\\nYou know what? I\\'m okay.\\nHow do you make them do that?\\nAnts can lift objects 50 times their weight.\\nThey build, farm, they cooperate with each other.\\nRight. But how do you make them do that?\\nI use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.\\nI speak to them.\\nI can go anywhere, hear anything,\\nand see everything.\\nAnd still know absolutely nothing.\\nI\\'m late to meet Cross.\\nUh... Dr. Pym?\\nYou don\\'t need to raise your hand, Scott.\\nSorry, I just have one question.\\nWho are you, who is she, what the hell\\'s going on,\\nand can I go back to jail now?\\nCome with me.\\n40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.\\nHuh?\\nI learned how to change the distance between atoms.\\nThat\\'s what powers the suit.\\nThat\\'s why it works.\\nWow.\\n- Whoa! - But it was dangerous.\\nIt was too dangerous.\\nSo I hid it from the world.\\nAnd that\\'s when I switched gears and I started my own company.\\nPym Tech.\\nYes.\\nI took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.\\nDarren Cross.\\nHe\\'s a big deal.\\nBut before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.\\nI thought I saw something in him. The son I never had, perhaps.\\nHe was brilliant, but as we became close,\\nhe began to suspect that I wasn\\'t telling him everything.\\nHe heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,\\nand he became obsessed with recreating my formula.\\nBut I wouldn\\'t help him.\\nSo he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.\\nHow could he do that?\\nThe board\\'s chairman is my daughter, Hope.\\nShe was the deciding vote.\\nBut she came back to me\\nwhen she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.\\nThe process is highly volatile.\\nIf one isn\\'t protected by a specialized helmet,\\nit can affect the brain\\'s chemistry.\\nI don\\'t think Darren realizes this,\\nand, you know, he\\'s not the most stable guy to begin with.\\nSo, what do you want from me?\\nScott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.\\nDo you?\\nI do.\\nIf you can help me,\\nI promise I can help you be with your daughter again.\\nNow, are you ready to redeem yourself?\\nAbsolutely.\\nMy days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.\\nWhat do you want me to do?\\nI want you to break into a place and steal some shit.\\nAre you gonna be home for dinner tonight?\\nUh, yeah. I\\'ll pick something up. Text me.\\nOkay. Good news?\\nUh... I don\\'t know. It\\'s news.\\nAre you trying to find my daddy?\\nYeah, I am, sweetheart.\\nI just want your daddy to be safe.\\nHope you don\\'t catch him.\\nThis isn\\'t the first time these guys\\nhave tried to get their hands on game-changing weaponry.\\nThat\\'s Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nPresently in the business of toppling governments.\\nHe always wanted my tech.\\nAnd now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket\\nand destroy all the data,\\nDarren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.\\nI think our first move should be calling the Avengers.\\nI spent half my life\\ntrying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.\\nI\\'m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.\\nThis is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.\\nThis could change the texture of reality.\\nBesides, they\\'re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.\\nOkay, then why don\\'t you just send the ants?\\nScott, they are ants.\\nAnts, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader.\\nSomebody that could infiltrate a place that\\'s designed to prevent infiltration.\\nHank, I\\'m a thief, all right? I mean, I\\'m a good thief, but this is insane.\\nHe\\'s right, Hank. And you know it.\\nYou\\'ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of.\\nI was against using him when we had months,\\nand now we have days.\\nI\\'m wearing the suit.\\nAbsolutely not!\\nI know the facility inside and out. I know how Cross thinks.\\nI know this mission better than anybody here.\\nWe need you close to Cross. Otherwise, this mission cannot work.\\n- We don\\'t have time to screw around! - Hope, please listen to me...\\nHe is a criminal! I\\'m your daughter.\\nNo!\\nShe\\'s right, Hank.\\nI\\'m not your guy.\\nWhy don\\'t you wear the suit?\\nYou think I don\\'t want to?\\nI can\\'t.\\nI spent years wearing it,\\nand it took a toll on me.\\nYou\\'re our only option.\\nBefore Hope lost her mother,\\nshe used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world.\\nAnd now she looks at me and there\\'s just disappointment.\\nIt\\'s too late for me,\\nbut not for you.\\nThis is your chance.\\nThe chance to earn that look in your daughter\\'s eyes.\\nTo become the hero that she already thinks you are.\\nIt\\'s not about saving our world.\\nIt\\'s about saving theirs.\\nDamn. That was a good speech.\\nScott,\\nI need you to be the Ant-Man.\\nIn the right hands,\\nthe relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.\\nThe suit has power. The man harnesses that power.\\nYou need to be skillful, agile, and above all,\\nyou need to be fast.\\nYou should be able to shrink and grow\\non a dime.\\nSo your size always suits your needs.\\nNow dive through the keyhole, Scott.\\nYou charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big.\\nOw!\\nAhhh!\\nOw!\\nUseless.\\nWhen you\\'re small, energy\\'s compressed,\\nso you have the force of a 200-pound man\\nbehind a fist a 100th of an inch wide. You\\'re like a bullet.\\nYou punch too hard, you kill someone. Too soft, it\\'s a love tap.\\nIn other words, you have to know how to punch.\\nI was in prison for three years. I know how to punch.\\nShow me.\\n- Terrible. - You wanna show me how to punch?\\nShow me...\\nThat\\'s how you punch.\\n- She\\'s been looking forward to this. - No kidding.\\nHope trained in martial arts at a difficult time.\\nOh, by \"difficult time,\" he means when my mother died.\\nWe lost her in a plane crash.\\nIt\\'s bad enough you won\\'t tell me how she died.\\nCould you please stop telling me that lie?\\nWe\\'re working, here.\\nAll right, princess. Let\\'s get back to work.\\nWere you going for the hand?\\nYou know, I think this regulator is holding me back.\\nDo not screw with the regulator.\\nIf that regulator is compromised,\\nyou would go subatomic.\\nWhat does that mean?\\nIt means that you would enter a quantum realm.\\nWhat does that mean?\\nIt means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space\\nbecome irrelevant\\nas you shrink for all eternity.\\nEverything that you know\\nand love,\\ngone forever.\\nCool. Yeah, if it ain\\'t broke...\\nYou\\'ve learned about the suit,\\nbut you\\'ve yet to learn about your greatest allies,\\nthe ants.\\nLoyal, brave,\\nand your partners on this job.\\nParatrechina longicornis. Commonly known as crazy ants.\\nThey\\'re lightning fast and can conduct electricity,\\nwhich makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics.\\nYou\\'re not so crazy.\\nHey!\\nYou\\'re cute.\\nThat was a lot scarier a second ago.\\nIt looks like the Futures Lab has its own isolated power supply.\\nThere\\'s a security guard posted around the clock.\\nWe\\'ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.\\nOkay, who\\'s next?\\nParaponera clavata.\\nI know. Bullet ants, right?\\nNumber 1 on the Schmidt pain index?\\nHey, guys. Remember me from the bedroom?\\nThe Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed,\\nAnd the only access point is a tube\\nwe estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.\\nWhy do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?\\nThe tube is protected by a laser grid,\\nand we can only power that down for 15 seconds.\\nYou\\'re gonna need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers,\\nretrieve the suit, and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on.\\nCamponotus pennsylvanicus.\\nAlternatively known as a carpenter ant.\\nIdeal for ground and air transport.\\nWait a minute, I know this guy.\\nI\\'m gonna call him \"Ant-thony.\"\\nThat\\'s good. That\\'s very good.\\nBecause this time, you\\'re really gonna have to learn how to control him.\\nTell them to put the sugar in the teacup.\\nAw! You okay? Did I hurt...\\nHank wants you outside for target practice.\\nThe suit has no weapons, so I made you these discs.\\nRed shrinks.\\nBlue enlarges.\\nSolenopsis mandibularis.\\nKnown for their bite,\\nthe fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects.\\nThey are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.\\nYou can do it, Scott. Come on.\\nThey\\'re not listening to me.\\nYou have to commit. You have to mean it.\\nNo shortcuts, no lies.\\nThrowing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.\\nWe don\\'t have time for coddling.\\nOur focus should be on helping Scott!\\nReally?\\nIs that where our focus should be?\\nHope!\\nI don\\'t know why I came to you in the first place.\\nWe can\\'t do this without her.\\nOh, God.\\nYou gotta lock your doors.\\nI mean, really, there\\'s some weird folks in this neighborhood.\\nDo you think this is a joke?\\nDo you have any idea what he\\'s asking you to risk?\\nYou have a daughter.\\nI\\'m doing this for her.\\nYou know, when my mother died, I didn\\'t see him for two weeks.\\nHe was in grief.\\nYeah, so was I, and I was seven.\\nAnd he never came back. Not in any way that counted.\\nHe just sent me off to boarding school.\\nYou know, I thought,\\nwith all that\\'s at stake,\\njust maybe we might have a chance of making peace.\\nBut, even now, he still wants to shut me out.\\nHe doesn\\'t wanna shut you out. He trusts you.\\nThen why are you here?\\nIt proves that he loves you.\\nHope. Look at me.\\nI\\'m expendable.\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m here.\\nYou must have realized that by now.\\nI mean, it\\'s why I\\'m in the suit and you\\'re not.\\nHe would rather lose this fight than lose you.\\nAnyway...\\nYou know, I didn\\'t know you had a daughter\\nwhen I called the cops on you.\\nWhat\\'s her name?\\nCassie.\\nIt\\'s a pretty name.\\nYou have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise.\\nThat\\'s how it works.\\nThink about Cassie.\\nAbout how badly you want to see her. And use that to focus.\\nOpen your eyes\\nand just think about what you want the ants to do.\\nThat\\'s good!\\nYour mother convinced me\\nto let her join me on my missions.\\nThey called her the Wasp.\\nShe was born to it.\\nAnd there\\'s not a day that goes by\\nthat I don\\'t regret having said yes.\\nIt was 1987.\\nSeparatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk\\nand launched an ICBM at the United States.\\nThe only way to the internal mechanics\\nwas through solid titanium.\\nI knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile.\\nBut my regulator had sustained too much damage.\\nYour mother,\\nshe didn\\'t hesitate.\\nJanet! No!\\nShe turned off her regulator\\nand went subatomic\\nto deactivate the bomb.\\nAnd she was gone.\\nYour mom died a hero.\\nAnd I spent the next 10 years\\ntrying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.\\nYou were trying to bring her back.\\nBut all I learned was we know nothing.\\nIt\\'s not your fault.\\nShe made her choice.\\nBut why didn\\'t you tell me that sooner?\\nI was trying to protect you.\\nI lost your mother.\\nI didn\\'t mean to lose you, too.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nThis is awesome.\\nIt\\'s awesome, you know?\\nYou guys are breaking down walls, you\\'re healing.\\nIt\\'s important.\\nI ruined the moment, didn\\'t I?\\nYes, you did. Yes.\\nI\\'m going to make some tea.\\nNailed it!\\nThat\\'s a good boy, Ant-thony.\\nThe final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.\\nIt\\'s freezing!\\nYou couldn\\'t make a suit with a flannel lining?\\nYou must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.\\nIt\\'s a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.\\nWe need it to counteract the transmission blockers\\nthat Cross installed in the Futures vault.\\nIt\\'s currently collecting dust\\nin one of Howard Stark\\'s old storage facilities in upstate New York.\\nShould be a piece of cake.\\nYou\\'re over the target area.\\nDisengage now, Scott!\\nSquadron A, go!\\nB, go!\\nC, go!\\nAll right, Ant-thony, please don\\'t drop me this time.\\nOh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!\\nStay calm.\\nGuys? We might have a problem.\\nHank, didn\\'t you say this was some old warehouse?\\nIt\\'s not!\\nYou son of a bitch!\\n- Scott, get out of there. - Abort!\\nAbort now!\\nNo, it\\'s okay. It doesn\\'t look like anyone\\'s home.\\nAnt-thony, get me to the roof!\\nHe\\'s gonna lose the suit.\\nHe\\'s gonna lose his life.\\nAll right, I\\'m on the roof of the target building.\\nSomebody\\'s home, Scott.\\nWhat\\'s going on down there, Sam?\\nIt\\'s the Falcon!\\nI had a sensor trip but I\\'m not seeing anything.\\nWait a second.\\nAbort, Scott! Abort now!\\nIt\\'s okay. He can\\'t see me.\\nI can see you.\\nHe can see me.\\nHi. I\\'m Scott.\\nDid he just say, \"Hi, I\\'m Scott\"?\\n- What are you doing here? - First off, I\\'m a big fan.\\nAppreciate it. So, who the hell are you?\\nI\\'m Ant-Man.\\n\"Ant-Man\"?\\nWhat? You haven\\'t heard of me?\\nNo, you wouldn\\'t have heard of me.\\nYou wanna tell me what you want?\\nI was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.\\nJust for a few days. I\\'m gonna return it.\\nI need it to save the world. You know how that is.\\nI know exactly how that is.\\nLocated the breach.\\n- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!\\nWhat the hell are you doing?\\nBreach is an adult male, who has some sort of shrinking tech.\\nSorry!\\nLook, I\\'m sorry about this. Sorry.\\nThat\\'s enough!\\nAnt-thony! A little help!\\nI\\'ve lost visual.\\nHe\\'s inside my pack!\\nSorry!\\nYou seem like a really great guy.\\nIt\\'s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.\\nThat was completely irresponsible and dangerous!\\nYou jeopardized everything!\\nYou got it.\\nWell done.\\nWait a minute.\\nDid you just compliment me?\\n- He did, didn\\'t he? - Kind of sounded like he did.\\nI was good, wasn\\'t I?\\nHey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn\\'t die?\\nLet us not dwell on the past.\\nWe gotta finish our planning.\\nDon\\'t mind him.\\nYou did good.\\nDarren.\\nHow the hell did you get in here?\\nYou left the front door open, Hank.\\nIt\\'s official.\\nYou\\'re old.\\nThe plans.\\nHe will kill him.\\nWell, to what do I owe this pleasure?\\nI have good news.\\nReally?\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nPym Tech, the company you created,\\nis about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world.\\nWe\\'re anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.\\nYou\\'re welcome.\\nI know this is odd, but I\\'d like you to be there.\\nThis is my moment. I want you to see it.\\nSure, Darren. Yeah, sure.\\nI\\'ll be there.\\nWhat did you see in me?\\nI don\\'t know what you mean.\\nAll those years ago, you picked me.\\nWhat did you see?\\nI saw myself.\\nThen why did you push me away?\\nBecause I saw too much of myself.\\nHe knows. He\\'s baiting you.\\nWe have to call it off.\\nWe\\'re all taking risks.\\nWhat if he saw me here?\\nHe didn\\'t. There\\'s no way.\\nHow do you know that?\\nDarren, hi.\\nHope, where are you right now?\\nI\\'m at home. Why?\\nI just saw Hank.\\nI still get nothing but contempt from him.\\nDon\\'t let him rile you up. He\\'s just a senile old man.\\nWe need to start everyone working around the clock.\\nGet the assembly line up and running.\\nAnd I\\'m tripling security.\\nFull sensors at all entrances\\nand exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.\\nGreat. Good idea.\\nThank you, Hope. I\\'m so lucky to have you on my team.\\nHe\\'s tripling security. He\\'s lost his mind, and he\\'s onto you.\\nBut he is not onto you.\\nHe\\'s adding full body scanners to all entrances\\nand closing exterior vents.\\nHow are we gonna get Scott inside?\\nThe water main.\\nYou can\\'t add security to a water main.\\nThe pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,\\nthat\\'s how I get in.\\nSomebody would have to reach the building\\'s control center\\nto change the water pressure.\\nHank and I will be beside Cross. How are we supposed to do that?\\nSo we expand our team.\\nWhat do we need?\\nA fake security guard on the inside to de-pressurize the water system,\\nsomebody else to hack in to the power supply\\nand kill the laser grid,\\nand a getaway guy.\\nNo, no. No, no, no. Not those three Wombats. No way.\\nThank you for the coffee, ma\\'am.\\nIt\\'s not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back.\\nBecause we just robbed you.\\nYou know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?\\nTwo smoothie machines.\\nAre you sure they can handle this?\\nOh, we can handle it. We\\'re professionals.\\nYou\\'ll forgive us if we\\'re not instilled with confidence.\\nWell, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man.\\nWe know our business.\\nWe broke into this spooky-ass house, didn\\'t we?\\nI let you.\\nWell, one could say that I let you let me.\\n- Look, it\\'s okay.

That\\'s so cool, bro!\\nNow, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?\\nIt\\'s pretty freaky, but it\\'s safe. There\\'s no reason to be scared.\\nOh, no, no. Daddy don\\'t get scared.\\n- Really? - Yeah.\\nGood.\\nThis is the work of gypsies.\\nThat\\'s witchcraft.\\nWow, that\\'s amazing.\\nThat\\'s like some David Copperfield shit.\\nThat\\'s some kind of wizardry.\\nThis is sorcery!\\nHow\\'d you do that, bro?\\nDon\\'t freak out. Look at your shoulder.\\nAhhh!\\nGet off! Get off!\\nWait, I thought Daddy didn\\'t get scared!\\nI gave them each half a Xanax\\nand Hank explained the science of the suit to them.\\nThey fell right asleep.\\nHey, look, I wanna thank you for...\\nNo, please don\\'t.\\nWe\\'re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.\\nI\\'m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.\\nHey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.\\nYou know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you\\nto almost liking you.\\nYou really should write poetry.\\nGet some sleep, Scott.\\nAll right, just so we\\'re clear, everyone here knows their role, right?\\n- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.\\n- Kurt? - Eyes in the sky.\\n- Luis? - Oh, man, you know it.\\nYou know what?

I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover.\\nLike a whistling. You know what I\\'m saying? To like, blend in.\\nNo. Don\\'t whistle. No whistling.\\nIt\\'s not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.\\nAll clear in Sector One.\\nStep out.\\nAll clear.\\nWe\\'re set.\\nWish me luck.\\nUtilities online.\\nHey! What are you doing?\\nUh...

Oh, my God!\\n- Luis. - Okay, sorry. Sorry.\\nYou know, I just get excited and stuff.\\nBut anyway, Ignacio tells me,\\n\"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick at the Spot last night.

You know what I\\'m sayin\\'?\\n\"She\\'s crazy-stupid fine, right?\"\\nThe bartender\\'s all like, \"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine.\"\\nSo this writer chick tells Ignacio,\\n\"Yo, I\\'m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,\\n\"and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,\\n\"you know what I\\'m saying?\"\\nIgnacio\\'s like, \"For real?\"\\nAnd she\\'s like, \"Yeah, you know what, I can\\'t tell you who my contact is,\\n\"because he works with the Avengers.\"\\nOh, no.\\nYeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.\\nLike, he comes up to her and says,\\n\"Yo, I\\'m looking for this dude who\\'s new on the scene,\\n\"who\\'s flashing his fresh tack,\\n\"who\\'s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?\"\\nAnd she\\'s like, \"Well, we got everything nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.\\n\"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.\\n\"You gotta be more specific.\"\\nAnd he\\'s like, \"I\\'m looking for a guy that shrinks.\"\\nAnd I\\'m, like, \"Damn!\" I got all nervous \\'cause I\\'d keep mad secrets for you, bro.\\nSo I asked Ignacio,\\n\"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick\\n\"to tell you to tell me, because I\\'m tight with Ant-Man,\\n\"that he\\'s looking for him?\"\\nAnd? What\\'d he say?\\nHe said, \"Yes.\"\\nThere\\'s something I want to show you.\\nI realized you can\\'t destroy power.\\nAll you can do is make sure that it\\'s in the right hands.\\nThis is an advanced prototype\\nthat your mother and I worked on together.\\nShe never got to use it.\\nBut now I realize that we were...

Now that I think about it...\\nOh! God, my original wound.\\n- 1983, all right? - Yes.\\nI\\'m 14 years old, I still have a nanny.

I just didn\\'t know that.\\nDrax, why aren\\'t you wearing one of Rocket\\'s aero-rigs?\\nIt hurts.\\nIt hurts?\\nI have sensitive nipples.\\n\"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!\"\\nWhat about him? What\\'s he doing?\\nI\\'m finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.\\nHow is that a priority?\\nBlame Quill. He\\'s the one who loves music so much.\\nNo, I actually agree with Drax on this.\\nThat\\'s hardly important right now.\\nOh, okay. Sure, Quill.\\nNo, seriously, I side with Drax.\\nNo, I understand that. You\\'re being very serious right now.\\nI can clearly see you winking.\\nDamn it. I\\'m using my left eye?\\nI am Groot.\\nThey were not looking at you funny.\\nWell, that\\'s intense.\\nGroot!\\nGroot, get out of the way! You\\'re gonna get hurt!\\nHi.\\nNo! Spit it out!\\nCome on!\\nDisgusting!\\nThe beast\\'s hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.\\nI must cut through it from the inside.\\nHuh?\\nNo, no! Drax, wait a minute!\\nDrax!\\nWhat is he doing?\\nHe said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside, so he...\\n- That doesn\\'t make any sense! - I tried telling him that!\\nSkin is the same level of thickness from the inside as from the outside!\\nI realize that.\\nThere is a cut on its neck.\\nRocket, get it to look up.\\nHey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!\\nWatch it, Quill!\\nYes! I have single-handedly...\\nvanquished the beast!\\nWhat?\\nWhat are they called again?\\nAnulax batteries.\\nHarbulary batteries.\\nThat\\'s nothing like what I just said.\\nBut they\\'re worth thousands of units apiece...\\nwhich is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.\\nCareful what you say around these folks. They\\'re easily offended.\\nThe cost of transgression is death.\\nWe thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.\\nWe could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.\\nEvery citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.\\nImpeccable, both physically and mentally.\\nWe control the DNA of our progeny...\\ngerminating them in birthing pods.\\nI guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.\\nPerhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...\\nin the archaic ways of our ancestors.\\nFor academic purposes.\\nI would be honored, yes.\\nIn the name of research...\\nI think that could be pretty, uh...\\nrepulsive.\\nI\\'m not into that kind of casual...\\nOh, please.\\nYour people promised something in exchange for our services.\\nBring it...\\nand we shall gladly be on our way.\\nFamily reunion. Yay.\\nI understand she is your sister.\\nShe\\'s worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.\\nOur soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.\\nDo with her as you please.\\nWe thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.\\nWhat is your heritage, Mr. Quill?\\nMy mother is from Earth.\\nAnd your father?\\nHe ain\\'t from Missouri. That\\'s all I know.\\nI see it within you.\\nAn unorthodox genealogy.\\nA hybrid that seems particularly...\\nreckless.\\nYou know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags...\\nbut that isn\\'t true at all.\\nOh, shit.\\nI\\'m using my wrong eye again, aren\\'t I?\\nI\\'m sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.\\nCount yourself blessed they didn\\'t kill you.\\nYou\\'re telling me.\\nYou wanna buy some batteries?\\nAll right, let\\'s get baldy to Xandar\\nand collect that bounty.\\nThat stuff about my father...\\nWho does she think she is?\\nI know you\\'re sensitive about that.\\nI\\'m not sensitive about it. I just don\\'t know who he is.\\nSorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.\\nI wasn\\'t.\\nI don\\'t care if you were.\\nWell, I feel like you do care.\\nThat\\'s why I\\'m apologizing. So, sorry!\\nGamora is not the one for you, Quill.\\nDamn shadow.\\nThere are two types of beings in the universe...\\nthose who dance, and those who do not.\\nMmm-hmm.\\nI first met my beloved at a war rally.\\nOh, God.\\nEveryone in the village flailed about, dancing.\\nExcept one woman.\\nMy Ovette.\\nI knew immediately she was the one for me.\\nThe most melodic song in the world could be playing.\\nShe wouldn\\'t even tap her foot.\\nWouldn\\'t move a muscle.\\nOne might assume she was dead.\\nThat does sound pretty hot.\\nIt would make my nether regions engorge.\\nOkay. I get it, yes.\\nI\\'m a dancer, Gamora is not.\\nYou just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.\\nMmm.\\nI\\'m hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.\\nNo. It\\'s not ripe yet...\\nand I hate you.\\nYou hate me?\\nYou left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.\\nAnd yet here you stand, a hero.\\nI will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.\\nI swear.\\nNo.\\nYou\\'re gonna live out the rest of your days\\nin a prison on Xandar...\\nwishing you could.\\nThis is weird.\\nWe\\'ve got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.\\nWhy would they do that?\\nProbably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.\\nDude!\\nRight.\\nHe didn\\'t steal some of those.\\nI don\\'t know why they\\'re after us. What a mystery this is.\\nWhat were you thinking?\\nDude, they were really easy to steal!\\n- That\\'s your defense? - Come on!\\nYou saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.\\nNow I\\'m teaching her a lesson!\\nOh, I didn\\'t realize your motivation was altruism.\\nIt\\'s really a shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...\\n- and they\\'re trying to kill us. - Exactly!\\nI was being sarcastic!\\nOh, no!\\nYou\\'re supposed to use a sarcastic voice!\\nNow I look foolish!\\nCan we put the bickering on hold...\\nuntil after we survive this massive space battle?\\n- More incoming! - Good!\\nI wanna kill some guys!\\nYou\\'re not killing anyone.\\nAll those ships are remotely piloted.\\nDamn it!\\nWhat is the delay, Admiral?\\nHigh Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible...\\nand could destroy the entire fleet.\\nOur concern is their slight against our people.\\nWe hired them and they steal from us.\\nIt is heresy of the highest order.\\nAll command modules...\\nfire with the intent to kill.\\nWhat\\'s the nearest habitable planet?\\nIt\\'s called Berhert.\\n- How many jumps? - Only one.\\nBut the access point is 47 clicks away.\\nAnd you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.\\nQuill, to make it through that...\\nyou\\'d have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.\\nLucky for us, I...\\nI am.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nI\\'ve been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.\\nI was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.\\nYou were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!\\nStop it.\\nLater on tonight, you\\'re gonna be laying down in your bed...\\nand there\\'s gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.\\nAnd you\\'re gonna be like, \"What\\'s this?\"\\nAnd it\\'s gonna be because I put a turd in there!\\nYou put your turd in my bed, I shave you.\\nOh, it won\\'t be my turd.\\nIt will be Drax\\'s.\\nI have famously huge turds.\\nWe\\'re about to die, and this is what we\\'re discussing?\\nSon of a...\\nDude! Seriously!\\nHey! Let me...\\nIdiots!\\nWell, that\\'s what you get\\nwhen Quill flies.\\nOw!\\nWe still have a Sovereign craft behind us.\\nOur weapons are down.\\n20 clicks to the jump!\\nHold on.\\nIt\\'s not ripe.\\nCome on, Zylak. You can do this.\\nYes!\\n15 clicks to the jump!\\nCome on!\\nKeep going!\\n10 clicks!\\nDie, spaceship!\\nYou suck, Zylak.\\nTypical.\\nFive clicks!\\nSon of a...\\nThey went around the field!\\nSomeone destroyed all our ships!\\nWhat?\\nWho?\\nOne click!\\n- What is that? - Who cares?\\nThat\\'s the jump point! Go!\\nIt\\'s a guy.\\nOh, my God.\\nHe\\'s still out there?\\nGroot, put your seatbelt on!\\nPrepare for a really bad landing!\\nThat was awesome!\\nYes!\\nLook at this!\\nWhere is the other half of our ship?\\nMy ship.\\nEither one of you could have gotten us through that field...\\nhad you flown with what\\'s between your ears\\ninstead of what\\'s between your legs!\\nIf what\\'s between my legs had a hand on it...\\nI guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.\\nPeter, we almost died because of your arrogance.\\nMore like because he stole...\\nthe Anulax batteries!\\nThey\\'re called Harbulary batteries.\\nNo, they\\'re not!\\nDo you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?\\nI\\'m not gonna answer to \"Star-Munch.\"\\nI did it because I wanted to!\\nDick.\\nWhat are we even talking about this for?\\nWe just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!\\nHow little?\\nWell, I don\\'t know, like this?\\nA little one-inch man saved us?\\nWell, if he got closer, I\\'m sure he would be much larger.\\nThat\\'s how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.\\nDon\\'t call me a raccoon!\\nI\\'m sorry. I took it too far.\\nI meant trash panda.\\nIs that better?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nIt\\'s worse. It\\'s so much worse.\\nYou son of a...\\nHey!\\n- I\\'ve had it with you! - No! Back up!\\nSomeone followed you through the jump point.\\nSet me free, you\\'ll need my help.\\nI\\'m not a fool, Nebula.\\nYou are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.\\nYou\\'ll attack me the moment I let you go.\\nNo, I won\\'t.\\nYou\\'d think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.\\nI bet it\\'s the one-inch man.\\nAfter all these years, I\\'ve found you.\\nAnd who the hell are you?\\nI figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.\\nMy name is Ego...\\nand I\\'m your dad, Peter.\\nYou know what they say...\\n\"You\\'re out of luck until you\\'ve gone duck.\"\\nYondu!\\nCome on down!\\nAfter going around years in circles...\\nwith this woman I end up marrying.\\nI said, \"Aleta, I love you, girl...\\n\"but you\\'re losing your mind!\"\\nThen again, she\\'s always been that way.\\nI could never trust her. You know?\\nStakar.\\nIt\\'s been some time.\\nIt seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.\\n- Sir! - Stakar!\\nThere\\'s a hundred Ravager factions.\\nYou lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.\\nPlease, sir. Please!\\nGet away from me.\\nYou can go to hell then!\\nI don\\'t give a damn what you think of me!\\nSo what are you following us for?\\nBecause you\\'re gonna listen to what I gotta say!\\nI don\\'t gotta listen to nothing!\\nYou betrayed the code!\\nRavagers don\\'t deal in kids.\\nI told you before! I didn\\'t know what was going on!\\nYou didn\\'t know because\\nyou didn\\'t want to know because it made you rich.\\nI demand a seat at the table!\\nI wear these flames, same as you.\\nYou may dress like us...\\nbut you\\'ll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.\\nAnd the Colors of Ogord...\\nwill never flash over your grave.\\nIf you think...\\nI take pleasure in exiling you...\\nyou\\'re wrong.\\nYou broke all our hearts.\\nAh, pathetic.\\nFirst, Quill betrays us...\\nand Yondu just lets him go scot-free.\\nWe followed him because he was the one...\\nwho wasn\\'t afraid to do what needed to be done.\\nSeems he\\'s goin\\' soft.\\nIf he\\'s so soft, why are you whispering?\\nYou know I\\'m right, Kraglin.\\nYou best be very careful what you say about our captain.\\nWho the hell is that?\\nYondu Udonta...\\nI have a proposition for you.\\nI hired Yondu to pick you up...\\nwhen your mother passed away.\\nBut instead of returning you...\\nYondu kept you.\\nI have no clue as to why.\\nWell, I\\'ll tell you why.\\nBecause I was a skinny little kid\\nwho could squeeze into places adults couldn\\'t.\\nIt made it easier for thievin\\'.\\nWell, I\\'ve been trying to track you down ever since.\\nI thought Yondu was your father.\\nWhat? We\\'ve been together this whole time...\\nand you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?\\nYou look exactly alike.\\nOne\\'s blue!\\nNo, he\\'s not my father!\\nYondu was the guy who abducted me...\\nkicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight...\\nand kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.\\n- Eat you? - Yeah.\\nOh, that son of a bitch.\\nHow\\'d you locate us now?\\nWell, even where I reside, out past the edge of what\\'s known...\\nwe\\'ve heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.\\nWhat say we head out there right now?\\nYour associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there.\\nI promise you...\\nit\\'s unlike any other place you\\'ve ever seen.\\nAnd there...\\nI can explain your very special heritage.\\nFinally get to be...\\nthe father I\\'ve always wanted to be.\\nExcuse me.\\nI\\'ve gotta take a whiz.\\nI\\'m not buying it.\\nLet\\'s go take a walk.\\nI am Mantis.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nSmiling.\\nI hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.\\nNot if you do it like that.\\nOh...\\nI was raised alone on Ego\\'s planet.\\nI do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.\\nCan I pet your puppy? It is adorable.\\nYes.\\nThat is called a practical joke!\\nI liked it very much!\\nI just made it up!\\nGive me a break!\\nAfter all this time,\\nyou\\'re gonna show up, and all of a sudden...\\n- you wanna be my dad? - I hear you.\\nAnd by the way, this could be a trap.\\nThe Kree purists, the Ravagers...\\n- they all want us dead. - I know, but...\\nBut what?\\nWhat was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?\\nWho?\\nHe owned a magic boat?\\nDavid Hasselhoff?\\nRight.\\nNot a magic boat. A talking car.\\nWhy did he talk again?\\nTo help him fight crime, and to be supportive.\\nAs a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket...\\nand you would tell all the other children...\\nthat he was your father, but that he was out of town.\\nShooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.\\nI told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?\\nI love that story.\\nI hate that story.\\nIt\\'s so sad!\\nAs a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad.\\nAnd I wanted that, more than anything in the world!\\nThat\\'s my point, Peter.\\nWhat if this man is your Hasselhoff?\\nIf he ends up being evil...\\nwe will just kill him.\\nYou\\'re leaving me with that fox?\\nHe\\'s not a fox.\\nShoot her if she does anything suspicious.\\n- Or if you feel like it. - Okay.\\nIt\\'ll be just a couple of days.\\nWe\\'ll be back before Rocket\\'s finished fixing the ship.\\nWhat if the Sovereign come?\\nThere\\'s no way for them to know we\\'re here. Let\\'s go.\\nI\\'m uncertain about parting ways.\\nGod, you\\'re like an old woman.\\nBecause I\\'m wise?\\nWhy do you have so much luggage?\\nI don\\'t want Groot playing with my things.\\nI hope Daddy isn\\'t as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.\\nWhat is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?\\nBecause it\\'s working.\\nAnd if you don\\'t love me now You will never love me again\\nI can still hear you saying You would never break the chain\\nAnd if you don\\'t love me now\\nYou will never love me again\\nI can still hear you saying\\nYou would never break the chain\\nAnd if you don\\'t love me now\\nYou will never love me again\\nI can still hear you saying\\nYou would never break the chain\\nHey, can I ask you a personal question?\\nOh...\\nNo one has ever asked me a personal question.\\nYour antennae, what are they for?\\nTheir purpose?\\nYes. Quill and I have a bet.\\nDude. You\\'re not supposed to say that!\\nI say...\\nif you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...\\nyour antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.\\nRight.

I\\'m keeping it.\\n- That was my favorite knife. - Listen!\\nI could care less whether you live or whether you die.\\n- Then why stop the big guy? - Simple.\\nYou know where to sell my Orb.\\nHow are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?\\nMy friend Rocket, here,\\nhas escaped 22 prisons.\\nWe\\'re getting out.\\nAnd then we\\'re headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.\\nHow much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?\\nFour billion units.\\n- What? - Holy shit.\\nThat Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan.\\nIf you free us,\\nI\\'ll lead you to the buyer directly and I\\'ll split the profit between the three of us.\\nI am Groot.\\nFour of us.\\nAsleep for the danger, awake for the money, as per frickin\\' usual.\\nYou have been betrayed, Ronan.\\nWe know only that she has been captured.\\nGamora may yet recover the Orb.\\nNo! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.\\nLook, your partnership with Thanos\\nis at risk.\\nThanos requires your presence. Now!\\nWith all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess,\\nand yet you summon me.\\nI would lower my voice, Accuser.\\nFirst, she lost a battle with some primitive.\\nThanos put Gamora under your charge.\\nThen she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.\\nYou are the one here with nothing to show for it.\\nYour sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!\\nLower your tone!\\nI may be your...\\nI only ask that you take this matter seriously.\\nThe only matter I do not take seriously, boy,\\nis you.\\nYour politics bore me.\\nYour demeanor is that of a pouty child.\\nAnd, apparently, you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.\\nI shall honor our agreement, Kree,\\nif you bring me the Orb.\\nBut return to me again empty-handed,\\nand I will bathe the starways in your blood.\\nThanks, Dad. Sounds fair.\\nThis is one fight you won\\'t win.\\nLet\\'s head to the Kyln.\\nIf we\\'re gonna get out of here, we\\'re gonna need to get into that watchtower.\\nAnd to do that, I\\'m gonna need a few things.\\nThe guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs. I need one.\\nLeave it to me.\\nThat dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.\\n- His leg? - Yeah.\\nGod knows I don\\'t need the rest of him. Look at him, he\\'s useless.\\nAll right.\\nAnd finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.\\n- Do you see it? - Yeah.\\nThere\\'s a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires.\\nTo get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.\\nHow are we supposed to do that?\\nWell, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.\\nSo, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.\\nYou must be joking.\\nNo, I really heard they find you attractive.\\nLook, it\\'s 20 feet up in the air,\\nand it\\'s in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.\\nIt\\'s impossible to get up there without being seen.\\nI got one plan, and that plan requires a frickin\\' quarnyx battery,\\nso figure it out!\\nCan I get back to it? Thanks.\\nNow, this is important. Once the battery is removed,\\neverything is gonna slam into emergency mode.\\nOnce we have it, we gotta move quickly, so you definitely need to get that last.\\nOr we could just get it first and improvise.\\n- I\\'ll get the armband. - Leg.\\nPrisoner, drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,\\nor we will open fire.\\nI am\\nGroot!\\nFire!\\nAll prisoners return to your sleeping areas.\\nYou idiot!\\nHow am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?\\nThe animal is in control.\\nFire on my command!\\nCreepy little beast!\\nOh, yeah.\\nYou need my what?\\n- I\\'ll need this. - Good luck.\\nIt\\'s internally wired.\\nI\\'ll figure something out.\\nDrop the leg!\\nDrop the leg and move back to your cell!\\nRocket!\\nMove to the watchtower!\\nYou!\\nMan who has lain with an A\\'askavariian!\\nIt was one time, man.\\nWe need all available guards in full combat gear...\\nSpare me your foul gaze, woman.\\nWhy is this one here?\\nWe promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss.\\nI always keep my promises, when they\\'re to muscle-bound whack-jobs\\nwho will kill me if I don\\'t. Here you go.\\nI was just kidding about the leg. I just need these two things.\\n- What? - No, I thought it\\'d be funny.\\nWas it funny? Wait, what did he look like hopping around?\\nI had to transfer him 30,000 units!\\nHow are we going to leave?\\nWell, he\\'s got a plan. Right? Or is that another thing you made up?\\nI have a plan! I have a plan!\\nCease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.\\nYeah, I\\'ll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.\\nDo not ever call me a thesaurus.\\nIt\\'s just a metaphor, dude.\\nHis people are completely literal. Metaphors are gonna go over his head.\\nNothing goes over my head.\\nMy reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.\\nI\\'m gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.\\nThose are some big guns.\\nOn my command!\\nNumber one!\\n- Rodent, we are ready for your plan. - Hold on!\\nNumber two!\\nI recognize this animal. We\\'d roast them over a flame pit as children.\\n- Their flesh was quite delicious. - Not helping!\\nNumber three!\\nAll fire on my command!\\nThree!\\nTwo!\\nOne!\\nHe turned off the artificial gravity,\\neverywhere but in here.\\nI told you I had a plan.\\nThat was a pretty good plan.\\nYeah! There it is. Get my ship.\\nIt\\'s the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.\\nThey crumpled my pants up into a ball.\\nThat\\'s rude! They folded yours.\\nThe Orb\\'s there. Let\\'s go.\\n- Wait, wait, wait. - What?\\nThat bastard didn\\'t put it back.\\n- Put what back? - Here.\\nGet them to the ship. I will be right back.\\n- How are you gonna possibly... - Just keep the Milano close by.\\nGo.\\nGo!\\nMy neck!\\nWell, how\\'s he gonna get to us?\\nHe declined to share that information with me.\\nWell, screw this, then!\\nI ain\\'t waiting around for some humie with a death wish. You got the Orb, right?\\nYes.\\nIf we don\\'t leave now, we will be blown to bits.\\nNo!\\nWe\\'re not leaving without the Orb.\\nBehold.\\nThis one shows spirit.\\nHe shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.\\nCompanion, what were you retrieving?\\nYou\\'re an imbecile.\\nYo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?\\nYou can\\'t take apart my ship without asking me!\\n- See, what is this? - Don\\'t touch that!\\nIt\\'s a bomb.\\n- A bomb? - Yup.\\nAnd you leave it lying around?\\nI was gonna put it in a box.\\nWhat\\'s a box gonna do?\\n- How about this one? - No! Hey!\\n- Leave it alone. - Why? What is it?\\n- Shut up. - Hey!\\nWhat is that?\\nThat\\'s for if things get really hardcore.\\nOr if you wanna blow up moons.\\nNo one\\'s blowing up moons.\\nYou just wanna suck the joy out of everything.\\nSo, listen, I\\'m gonna need your buyer\\'s coordinates.\\nWe\\'re heading in the right direction. For now.\\nIf we\\'re gonna work together, you might try trusting me a little bit.\\nAnd how much do you trust me?\\nI\\'d trust you a lot more if you told me what this was.\\nBecause I\\'m guessing it\\'s some kind of weapon.\\nI don\\'t know what it is.\\nIf it\\'s a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.\\nPut it down, you fool. You\\'ll destroy us all.\\nOr just you, murderess!\\nI let you live once, princess!\\n- I am not a princess! - Hey!\\nNobody is killing anybody on my ship!\\nWe\\'re stuck together until we get the money.\\nI have no interest in money.\\nGreat.\\nThat means more money for the three of us.\\nFor the four of us. Partners.\\nWe have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you.\\nI\\'ll tell the buyer we\\'re on our way.\\nAnd Quill, your ship is filthy.\\nShe has no idea.\\nIf I had a black light,\\nthe place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.\\nYou got issues, Quill.\\nI swear. I don\\'t know where they went! I swear.\\nIf he knew where they were headed, he would have already told us.\\nYeah.\\nRonan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.\\nWell, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant.\\nFind the Orb. Any means, any price.\\n- And this place? - The Nova can\\'t know what we\\'re after.\\nCleanse it!\\nDo you got any other cute little buggers like this one?\\nI like to stick \\'em all in a row on my control console.\\nI can\\'t tell if you\\'re joking or not.\\nHe\\'s being fully serious.\\nIn that case, I can show you...\\nBut first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is,\\nand why everybody cares so damn much about it.\\nAnd then you gonna tell me,\\nwho out there might wanna buy it.\\nSir, the high-end community is a...\\nThe high-end community is a...\\nIt\\'s a tight-knit...\\nTight-knit...\\nThe high-end community is a very tight-knit...\\nI cannot possibly betray\\nthe confidentiality of my buyers!\\nNow, who again is this buyer of yours?\\nCarina.\\nYes, Master.\\nYour people do have elbows, do they not?\\nWe do, Master.\\nThen use them.\\nI don\\'t have to remind you\\nwhat happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.\\nDo I?\\nChop, chop. Our guests will be here soon.\\nHeads up! We\\'re inbound.\\nWhat is it?\\nIt\\'s called Knowhere.\\nThe severed head of an ancient celestial being.\\nBe wary headed in, rodent.\\nThere are no regulations whatsoever here.\\nHundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in\\nto mine the organic matter within the skull.\\nBone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.\\nAll rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy.\\nIt\\'s dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.\\nWell, I come from a planet of outlaws.\\nBilly the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.\\nIt sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.\\nYeah, you should.\\nExcuse me.\\n- Watch your wallets. - Can you spare any units?\\nGet out of here.\\nYour buyer\\'s in there?\\nWe are to wait here for his representative.\\nGet out of here!\\nThis is no respectable establishment.\\nWhat do you expect us to do while we wait?\\nYes! Yes!\\nYahoo!\\nMy Orloni has won,\\nas I won at all things!\\nNow, let\\'s put more of this liquid into our bodies.\\nThat\\'s the first thing you said that wasn\\'t bat-shit crazy!\\nMan, you wouldn\\'t believe what they charge for fuel out here.\\n- I might actually lose money on this job. - My connection is making us wait.\\nIt\\'s just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty.\\nWhere yours is more, \"Stab, stab. Those are my terms.\"\\n- My father didn\\'t stress diplomacy. - Thanos?\\nHe\\'s not my father.\\nWhen Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me.\\nHe tortured me, turned me into a weapon.\\nWhen he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan,\\nI couldn\\'t stand by and...\\nWhy would you risk your life for this?\\nMy mother gave it to me.\\nMy mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up.\\nI happened to have it on me,\\nwhen I was...\\nThe day that she...\\nYou know, when I left Earth.\\nWhat do you do with it?\\nDo? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.\\nI\\'m a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.\\nReally?\\nOn my planet, there\\'s a legend about people like you.\\nIt\\'s called\\nFootloose.\\nAnd in it, a great hero\\nnamed Kevin Bacon,\\nteaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...\\nIt\\'s the greatest thing there is.\\nWho put the sticks up their butts?\\nWhat? No, that\\'s just a...\\n- That is cruel. - It\\'s just a phrase\\npeople use.\\nThe melody is pleasant!\\n- No! - What the hell?\\nI know who you are, Peter Quill!\\nAnd I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...\\nYour pelvic sorcery!\\nThat is not what is happening here.\\nNo.\\nStop it!\\nWhat are you doing?\\nThis vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!\\n- That is true! - He has no respect!\\n- That is also true! - Hold on! Hold on!\\nKeep calling me vermin, tough guy!\\nYou just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!\\nRocket, you\\'re drunk. All right? No one\\'s laughing at you.\\nHe thinks I\\'m some stupid thing! He does!\\nWell, I didn\\'t ask to get made!\\nI didn\\'t ask to be torn apart,\\nand put back together, over and over\\nand turned into some...\\nSome little monster!\\nRocket, no one\\'s calling you a monster.\\nHe called me \"vermin\"!\\nShe called me \"rodent\"!\\nLet\\'s see if you can laugh\\nafter five or six good shots to your frickin\\' face!\\nNo, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket!\\nCome on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you\\'re rich.\\nFine. But I can\\'t promise,\\nwhen all this is over I\\'m not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.\\nSee? That\\'s exactly why none of you have any friends!\\nFive seconds after you meet somebody, you\\'re already trying to kill them!\\nWe have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.\\nAnd Ronan is no closer to being dead.\\n- Drax! - Let him go.\\nWe don\\'t need him.\\nMilady Gamora.\\nI\\'m here to fetch you for my master.\\nOkay, this isn\\'t creepy at all.\\nWe house the galaxy\\'s largest collection\\nof fauna, relics, and species of all manner.\\nI present to you,\\nTaneleer Tivan, The Collector.\\nOh, my dear Gamora.\\nHow wonderful to meet in the flesh.\\nLet\\'s bypass the formalities, Tivan.\\nWe have what we discussed.\\nWhat is that thing there?\\nI am Groot.\\nI never thought I\\'d meet a Groot.\\nSir...\\nYou must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass.\\nAt the moment of your death, of course.\\nI am Groot.\\nWhy, so he could turn you into a frickin\\' chair?\\nThat\\'s your pet?\\n- His what? - Tivan.\\nWe have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.\\nVery well, then.\\nLet us see what you brought.\\nThree quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.\\nNo, cases. Last time, you sent me...\\nYou shall send a message for me.\\nOh, my new friends.\\nBefore creation itself,\\nthere were six singularities.\\nThen the universe exploded into existence,\\nand the remnants of these systems\\nwere forged into concentrated ingots.\\nInfinity Stones.\\nThese stones, it seems,\\ncan only be brandished\\nby beings of extraordinary strength.\\nObserve.\\nThese carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations\\nlike wheat in a field.\\nThere\\'s a little pee coming out of me right now.\\nOnce, for a moment,\\na group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,\\nbut even they were quickly destroyed by it.\\nBeautiful.\\nBeyond compare.\\nWe\\'re all very fascinated, whitey. But we\\'d like to get paid.\\nHow would you like to get paid?\\nWhat do you think, fancy man? Units!\\nVery well, then.\\nCarina.\\nStand back.\\nI will no longer be your slave!\\nNo!\\nWhat the...\\nHow could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb?\\n- What do you still have it for? - What are we gonna do, leave it in there?\\n- I can\\'t believe you had that in your purse! - It\\'s not a purse, it\\'s a knapsack!\\nWe have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There\\'s a chance they can contain it.\\nAre you kidding me? We\\'re wanted by the Nova Corps.\\n- Just give it to Ronan! - So he can destroy the galaxy?\\nWhat are you, some saint all of a sudden?\\nWhat has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?\\nBecause I\\'m one of the idiots who lives in it!\\nPeter, listen to me. We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan\\'s hands.\\nWe have to go back to your ship, and deliver it to Nova.\\nRight, right, okay. I think you\\'re right.\\nOr we could give it to somebody who\\'s not going to arrest us,\\nwho\\'s really nice for a whole lot of money.\\nI think it\\'s a really good balance between both of your points of view.\\nYou\\'re despicable. Dishonorable.\\nFaithless!\\n- No. - At last!\\nI shall meet my foe and destroy him.\\nYou called Ronan?\\nQuill! Don\\'t you move, boy!\\nDon\\'t you move! Get out of the way!\\nRonan the Accuser!\\nYou are the one who transmitted the message?\\nYou killed my wife.\\nYou killed my daughter!\\nI told you, you can\\'t fit. Now, wait here. I\\'ll be back.\\nIt is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.\\nNo!\\nNebula,\\nretrieve the Orb.\\nThe Stone is in the furthest pod.\\nBring it down!\\nRocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.\\nHow? We\\'ve got no weaponry on these things.\\nThese pods are industrial grade.\\nThey\\'re nearly indestructible.\\nNot against necroblasts, they\\'re not.\\nThat\\'s not what I\\'m saying.\\nLet me borrow your ride.\\nI don\\'t recall killing your family.\\nI doubt I\\'ll remember killing you, either.\\nQuill, I\\'m trapped. I can\\'t make it to the Milano.\\nI have to head out.\\nWait! These things aren\\'t meant to go out there.\\nYou are a disappointment, sister.\\nOf all our siblings,\\nI hated you least.\\nNebula, please.\\nIf Ronan gets this stone\\n- he\\'ll kill us all. - Not all.\\nYou will already be dead.\\nRonan, it is done.\\nQuill, come on.\\nHer body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,\\nbut there\\'s nothing we can do for her.\\nThese pods aren\\'t meant to be out here.\\nIn a second, we\\'re gonna be in the same boat.\\nDamn it.\\nQuill?\\nYondu! Yondu.\\nThis is Quill!\\n- My coordinates are 227 K324. - Quill.\\nQuill, what are you doing?\\nJust outside Knowhere.\\nIf you\\'re there, come get me.\\nI\\'m all yours.\\nQuill, don\\'t be ridiculous.\\nGet back into your pod!\\nYou can\\'t fit two people in there. You\\'re gonna die.\\nYou\\'ll die in seconds!\\nQuill.\\nQuill?\\nWhat happened?\\nI saw you out there.\\nI don\\'t know what came over me.\\nBut I couldn\\'t let you die.\\nI found something inside of myself.\\nSomething\\nincredibly heroic.\\nI mean, not to brag,\\nbut, objectively...\\nWhere\\'s the Orb?\\nIt\\'s... Well, they got the Orb.\\nWhat?\\nWelcome home, Peter.\\nBlasted idiot. They\\'re all idiots!\\nQuill just got himself captured.\\nNone of this ever would have happened if you didn\\'t try to single-handedly\\ntake on a frickin\\' army!\\nYou\\'re right.\\nI was a fool.\\nAll the anger,\\nall the rage,\\nwas just to cover my loss.\\n\"My wife and child are dead.\"\\nI don\\'t care if it\\'s mean!\\nEverybody\\'s got dead people.\\nIt\\'s no excuse to get everybody else\\ndead along the way!\\nCome on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.\\nThe only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe\\nas fast as we can and maybe,\\njust maybe, we\\'ll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there.\\nI am Groot.\\nSave them? How?\\nI am Groot.\\nI know they\\'re the only friends that we ever had,\\nbut there\\'s an army of Ravagers around them.\\nAnd there\\'s only two of us!\\nThree.\\nYou\\'re making me\\nbeat... up\\ngrass!\\nThe Orb is in my possession,\\nas I promised.\\nBring it to me.\\nYes, that was our agreement.\\nBring you the Orb,\\nand you will destroy Xandar for me.\\nHowever, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,\\nI wonder what use I have for you.\\nBoy,\\nI would reconsider your current course.\\nMaster! You cannot!\\nThanos is the most powerful being in the universe.\\nNot anymore.\\nYou call me \"boy!\"\\nI will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,\\nand burn it to its core!\\nThen, Thanos,\\nI am coming for you.\\nAfter Xandar, you are going to kill my father?\\nYou dare to oppose me?\\nYou see what he has turned me into.\\nIf you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.\\nYou betray me?\\nSteal my money?\\nStop it! Leave him alone!\\nWhen I picked you up as a kid,\\nthese boys wanted to eat you.\\nThey ain\\'t never tasted Terran before.\\nI saved your life!\\nWill you shut up about that? God!\\nTwenty years, you been throwing that in my face,\\nlike it\\'s some great thing, not eating me.\\nNormal people don\\'t even think about eating someone else!\\nMuch less that person having to be grateful for it!\\nYou abducted me, man.\\nYou stole me from my home and from my family.\\nYou don\\'t give a damn about your Terra!\\nYou\\'re scared\\nbecause you\\'re soft in here.\\nHere, right here!\\nYondu!\\nListen to me.\\nRonan has something called an Infinity Stone.\\nI know what he\\'s got, girl.\\nThen you know we must get it back!\\nHe\\'s gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.\\nWe have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.\\nIs that what she\\'s been filling your head with, boy?\\nSentiment?\\nEating away your brain like maggots!\\nThat\\'s it.\\nNo!\\nSorry, boy.\\nBut a captain\\'s gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.\\nCaptain\\'s gotta teach stuff!\\nIf you kill me now,\\nyou are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.\\nThe Stone?\\nI hope you got something better than that.\\nBecause ain\\'t nobody stealing from Ronan.\\nWe got a ringer.\\nIs that right?\\nShe knows everything there is to know about Ronan.\\nHis ships,\\nhis army.\\nHe\\'s vulnerable.\\nHey, what do you say, Yondu?\\nMe and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.\\nLet him go!\\nYou always did have a scrote, boy!\\nThat\\'s why I kept you on as a young\\'un.\\nCaptain, the shot was non-damaging.\\nAttention, idiots.\\nThe lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer.\\nIt\\'s a weapon of my own design.\\nWhat the hell?\\nIf you don\\'t hand over our companions now,\\nhe\\'s gonna tear your ship a new one.\\nA very big new one!\\n- I ain\\'t buyin\\' it. - I\\'m giving you to the count of five.\\n- 5, 4, 3... - No! Wait, hold on!\\nRocket, it\\'s me, for God sakes!\\nWe figured it out! We\\'re fine!\\nHey, Quill. What\\'s going on?\\nYou call that \"figured it out\"?\\nWe\\'re gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.\\nYou want to talk about senseless?\\nHow about trying to save us by blowing us up?\\nWe were only gonna blow you up if they didn\\'t turn you over!\\nAnd how on earth were they gonna turn us over\\nwhen you only gave them a count of five?\\nWe didn\\'t have time to work out the minutiae of the plan.\\nThis is what we get for acting altruistically.\\n- I am Groot. - They are ungrateful.\\nWhat\\'s important now is we get the Ravagers\\' army to help us save Xandar.\\nSo we can give the Stone to Yondu who\\'s just gonna sell to somebody even worse?\\n- We\\'ll figure that part out later. - We have to stop Ronan.\\nHow?\\n- I have a plan. - You\\'ve got a plan?\\nYes.\\nFirst of all, you\\'re copying me from when I said I had a plan.\\nNo, I\\'m not. People say that all the time. It\\'s not that unique of a thing to say.\\nSecondly, I don\\'t even believe you have a plan.\\nI have part of a plan!\\nWhat percentage of a plan do you have?\\nYou don\\'t get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.\\nI just saved Quill.\\nWe\\'ve already established that you destroying the ship that I\\'m on is not saving me.\\n- When did we establish it? - Like three seconds ago!\\nI wasn\\'t listening. I was thinking of something else.\\nShe\\'s right. You don\\'t get an opinion. What percentage?\\n- I don\\'t know. Twelve percent. - Twelve percent?\\nThat\\'s a fake laugh.\\n- It\\'s real! - Totally fake.\\nThat is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life\\n- because that is not a plan. - It\\'s barely a concept.\\n- You\\'re taking their side? - I am Groot.\\nSo what, it\\'s better than 11%? What the hell does that have to do with anything?\\nThank you, Groot. Thank you.\\nSee? Groot\\'s the only one of you who has a clue.\\nGuys.\\nCome on.\\nYondu is gonna be here in two seconds.\\nHe expects to hear this big plan of ours.\\nI need your help.\\nI look around at us.\\nYou know what I see?\\nLosers.\\nI mean, like,\\nfolks who have lost stuff.\\nAnd we have. Man, we have. All of us.\\nOur homes,\\nour families,\\nnormal lives.\\nAnd, usually, life takes more than it gives. But not today.\\nToday, it\\'s given us something.\\nIt has given us a chance.\\nTo do what?\\nTo give a shit.\\nFor once.\\nNot run away.\\nI, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch\\nas Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.\\nBut, Quill, stopping Ronan,\\nit\\'s impossible.\\nYou\\'re asking us to die.\\nYeah, I guess I am.\\nQuill.\\nI have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.\\nI will be grateful to die among my friends.\\nYou are an honorable man, Quill.\\nI will fight beside you.\\nAnd in the end,\\nI will see my wife and daughter again.\\nI am Groot.\\nWhat the hell. I don\\'t got that long a lifespan, anyway.\\nNow I\\'m standing. Y\\'all happy?\\nWe\\'re all standing up now.\\nBunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.\\nThe Stone reacts to anything organic.\\nThe bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.\\nAll Ronan\\'s got to do is touch the Stone to the planet\\'s surface and zap.\\nAll plants, animals,\\n- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.\\nSo Ronan does not make the surface.\\nRocket will lead a team to blow a hole\\nin the Dark Aster\\'s starboard hull.\\nThen, our craft and Yondu\\'s will enter.\\nWon\\'t there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?\\nI think of Sakaaran as paper people.\\nOnce they know we\\'re on board,\\nRonan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck.\\nWhich I can disable by dismantling the power source.\\nWe\\'ll make it to the flight deck,\\nand I\\'ll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.\\nOnce Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.\\nUse these devices to contain it.\\nIf you touch it,\\nit will kill you.\\nI\\'ll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.\\nHopefully, they\\'ll believe we\\'re there to help.\\nThere\\'s one more thing we need to complete the plan.\\nThat guy\\'s eye.\\nNo! No, we don\\'t. No, we don\\'t need\\nthat guy\\'s eye.\\nNo, seriously, I need it! It\\'s important to me.\\nRonan\\'s fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in T-minus\\nfifteen minutes.\\nRemember, boy.\\nAt the end of all this,\\nI get the Stone.\\nYou cross me, we kill you all.\\nLet\\'s go get \\'em, boys!\\nThis is a terrible plan.\\nHey, you\\'re the one who said you wanted to die among friends.\\nNova Prime.\\nI received a transmission\\nfrom one of the Ravagers.\\nHe says Ronan\\'s in possession of something called an Infinity Stone\\nand he\\'s headed toward Xandar.\\nGood God.\\nIt\\'s a trick.

We are now one apiece.\\nI would like to try again.\\nWe\\'re tied up. Feel the tension?\\nIt\\'s fun.\\nThat was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.\\nAnd you\\'ve won.\\nCongratulations.\\nFair game.\\nGood sport.\\nYou have fun?\\nIt was fun.\\nThis thing on?\\nHey, Miss Potts. Pep.\\nIf you find this recording...\\ndon\\'t post it on social media.\\nIt\\'s gonna be a real tearjerker.\\nI don\\'t know if you\\'re ever gonna see these.\\nI don\\'t even know if you\\'re still...\\nOh, God, I hope so.\\nToday\\'s day 21.\\nNo, 22.\\nYou know, if it wasn\\'t for the existential terror...\\nof staring into the literal void of space, I\\'d say I\\'m feeling a little better today.\\nInfection\\'s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.\\nYou\\'d love her.\\nVery practical.\\nOnly a tiny bit sadistic.\\nSo, the fuel cells were cracked during battle...\\nand we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge...\\nand bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.\\nBut it\\'s now dead in the water.\\nThousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven.\\nOxygen will run out tomorrow morning...\\nand that\\'ll be it.\\nPep, I know I said no more surprises...\\nbut I got to say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.\\nBut it looks like...\\nWell, you know what it looks like.\\nDon\\'t feel bad about this.\\nI mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...\\nand then move on with enormous guilt...\\nI should probably lie down for a minute. Go rest my eyes.\\nPlease know...\\nwhen I drift off, it\\'ll be like every night lately.\\nI\\'m fine. Totally fine.\\nI dream about you.\\nBecause it\\'s always you.\\nCouldn\\'t stop him.\\nNeither could I.\\nHang on.\\nI lost the kid.\\nTony, we lost.\\nIs...?\\n- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!\\nOh, my God!\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nIt\\'s been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.\\nWorld governments are in pieces.\\nThe parts that are still working...\\nare trying to take a census and it looks like he did...\\nHe did exactly what he said he was gonna do.\\nThanos wiped out...\\n50% of all living creatures.\\nWhere is he now? Where?\\nWe don\\'t know.\\nHe just opened a portal and walked through.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with him?\\nHe\\'s pissed.\\nHe thinks he failed.\\nWhich, of course, he did...\\nbut there\\'s a lot of that going around, ain\\'t there?\\nHonestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.\\nMaybe I am.\\nWe\\'ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.\\nDeep space scans...\\nand satellites, and we got nothing.\\nTony, you fought him.\\nWho told you that?\\nI didn\\'t fight him.\\nNo, he wiped my face with a planet...\\nwhile the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.\\nThat\\'s what happened. There was no fight, \\'cause he\\'s not beatable.\\nDid he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?\\nI saw this coming a few years back.\\nI had a vision. I didn\\'t wanna believe it.\\nThought I was dreaming.\\nTony, I\\'m gonna need you to focus.\\nAnd I needed you.\\nAs in, past tense.\\nThat trumps what you need. It\\'s too late, buddy.\\nSorry.\\nYou know what I need? I need a shave.\\nAnd I believe I remember telling all youse...\\nTony, Tony!\\nAlive and otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world.\\nRemember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.\\nThat\\'s what we needed.\\nWell, that didn\\'t work out, did it?\\nI said we\\'d lose.\\nYou said, \"We\\'ll do that together, too.\"\\nAnd guess what, Cap?\\nWe lost.\\nAnd you weren\\'t there.\\nBut that\\'s what we do, right?\\nOur best work after the fact? We\\'re the \"Avengers.\"\\nWe\\'re the \"Avengers,\" not the \"Pre-vengers.\"\\n- Okay. - Right?\\nYou made your point. Just sit down, okay?\\nOkay. No, no, here\\'s my point. You know what?\\n- She\\'s great by the way. - Tony, you\\'re sick. Sit down.\\nWe need you. You\\'re new blood.\\nBunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap.\\nI got no coordinates...\\nno clues, no strategies, no options.\\nZero. Zip. Nada.\\nNo trust, liar.\\nHere, take this.\\nYou find him, you put that on...\\nyou hide.\\n- Tony! - I\\'m fine.\\nLet me...\\nBruce gave him a sedative.\\nHe\\'s gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.\\nYou guys take care of him...\\nand I\\'ll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.\\nWhere are you going?\\nTo kill Thanos.\\nHey.\\nYou know, we usually work as a team here...\\nand, between you and I, morale\\'s a little fragile.\\nWe realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight, too.\\nYou even know where he is?\\nI know people who might.\\nDon\\'t bother.\\nI can tell you where Thanos is.\\nThanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.\\nAnd when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.\\nEven disassembled, I wanted to please him.\\nI\\'d ask...\\nwhere would we go once his plan was complete?\\nAnd his answer was always the same.\\n\"To the Garden.\"\\nThat\\'s cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.\\nSo, where is he?\\nWhen Thanos snapped his fingers...\\nEarth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions.\\nNo one\\'s ever seen anything like it.\\nUntil two days ago...\\non this planet.\\nThanos is there.\\nHe used the stones again.\\nHey, hey, hey.\\nWe\\'d be going in shorthanded, you know?\\nLook, he\\'s still got the stones, so...\\nSo, let\\'s get \\'em.\\nUse them to bring everyone back.\\nJust like that?\\nYeah. Just like that.\\nEven if there\\'s a small chance that we can undo this...\\nI mean, we owe it to everyone who\\'s not in this room to try.\\nIf we do this, how do we know it\\'s gonna end any differently than it did before?\\nBecause before you didn\\'t have me.\\nHey, new girl?\\nEverybody in this room is about that superhero life.\\nAnd if you don\\'t mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?\\nThere are a lot of other planets in the universe.\\nAnd unfortunately, they didn\\'t have you guys.\\nI like this one.\\nLet\\'s go get this son of a bitch.\\nOkay.\\nWho here hasn\\'t been to space?\\nWhy?\\nYou better not throw up on my ship.\\nApproaching jump in three...\\ntwo, one.\\nI\\'ll head down for recon.\\nThis is gonna work, Steve.\\nI know it will.\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do if it doesn\\'t.\\nNo satellites. No ships. No armies.\\nNo ground defenses of any kind.\\nIt\\'s just him.\\nAnd that\\'s enough.\\nOh, no.\\nWhere are they?\\nAnswer the question.\\nThe universe required correction.\\nAfter that, the stones served no purpose...\\nbeyond temptation.\\nYou murdered trillions!\\nYou should be grateful.\\nWhere are the stones?\\nGone.\\nReduced to atoms.\\nYou used them two days ago!\\nI used the stones to destroy the stones.\\nIt nearly killed me.\\nBut the work is done.\\nIt always will be.\\nI am inevitable.\\nWe have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!\\nMy father is many things.\\nA liar is not one of them.\\nThank you, daughter.\\nPerhaps I treated you too harshly.\\nWhat?\\nWhat did you do?\\nI went for the head.\\nSo...\\nI went on a date the other day.\\nIt\\'s the first time in five years.\\nYou know? I\\'m sitting there at dinner.\\nI didn\\'t even know what to talk about.\\nWhat did you talk about?\\nSame old crap. You know, how things have changed.\\nMy job, his job.\\nHow much we miss the Mets.\\nAnd then things got quiet...\\nthen he cried as they were serving the salads.\\nWhat about you?\\nI cried just before dessert.\\nBut I\\'m seeing him again tomorrow, so...\\nThat\\'s great.\\nYou did the hardest part. You took the jump.\\nYou didn\\'t know where you were gonna come down.\\nAnd that\\'s it. That\\'s those little brave baby steps we got to take...\\nto try and become whole again, try and find purpose.\\nI went in the ice in \\'45, right after I met the love of my life.\\nWoke up 70 years later.\\nYou got to move on.\\nGotta move on.\\nThe world is in our hands.\\nIt\\'s left to us, guys.\\nAnd we got to do something with it.\\nOtherwise...\\nThanos should\\'ve killed all of us.\\nWhat the hell?\\nHope?\\nKid!\\nHey, kid!\\nWhat the hell happened here?\\nOh, my God!\\nOh, please!\\nPlease, please!\\nNo, no, no. No.\\nNo.\\nExcuse me. Sorry.\\nCassie, no.\\nNo, no, no.\\nNo, no.\\nPlease, please, please. No, Cassie.\\nWhat?\\nCassie?\\nDad?\\nYou\\'re so big!\\nYeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged.\\nIt was an infectious garbage scow.\\nSo, thanks for the hot tip.\\nWell, you were closer.\\nYeah. And now we smell like garbage.\\nYou get a reading on those tremors?\\n\\'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate.\\nDo we have a visual? How are we handling it?\\nNat.\\nIt\\'s an earthquake under the ocean.\\nWe handle it by not handling it.\\nCarol, are we seeing you here next month?\\n- Not likely. - What? You gonna get another haircut?\\nListen, fur face.\\nI\\'m covering a lot of territory.\\nThe things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere.\\nOn thousands of planets.\\nAll right, all right. That\\'s a good point. That\\'s a good point.\\nSo, you might not see me for a long time.\\nAll right. Well...\\nThis channel\\'s always active.\\nSo, if anything goes sideways...\\nanyone\\'s making trouble where they shouldn\\'t...\\ncomes through me.\\nOkay.\\nAll right.\\nGood luck.\\nWhere are you?\\nMexico.\\nThe Federales found a room full of bodies.\\nLooks like a bunch of cartel guys...\\nnever even had a chance to get their guns off.\\nIt\\'s probably a rival gang.\\nExcept it isn\\'t.\\nIt\\'s definitely Barton.\\nWhat he\\'s done here...\\nwhat he\\'s been doing for the last few years...\\nI mean, the scene that he left...\\nI got to tell you, there\\'s a part of me that doesn\\'t even wanna find him.\\nWill you find out where he\\'s going next?\\nNat?\\nPlease?\\nOkay.\\nYou know, I\\'d offer to cook you dinner...\\nbut you seem pretty miserable already.\\nYou here to do your laundry?\\nAnd to see a friend.\\nClearly, your friend is fine.\\nYou know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge.\\n- In the Hudson? - There\\'s fewer ships...\\ncleaner water.\\nYou know, if you\\'re about to tell me to look on the bright side...\\nI\\'m about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.\\nSorry.\\nForce of habit.\\nYou know, I keep telling everybody they should move on...\\nand grow.\\nSome do.\\nBut not us.\\nIf I move on, who does this?\\nMaybe it doesn\\'t need to be done.\\nI used to have nothing.\\nAnd then I got this.\\nThis job.\\nThis family.\\nAnd I was better because of it.\\nAnd even though they\\'re gone...\\nI\\'m still trying to be better.\\nI think we both need to get a life.\\nYou first.\\nHi, hi! Is anyone home?\\nThis is Scott Lang.\\nWe met a few years ago at the airport...\\nin Germany?\\nI was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.\\n- You wouldn\\'t recognize me. - Is this an old message?\\nAnt-Man? I know you know that.\\n- It\\'s the front gate. - I really need to talk to you guys.\\nScott.\\nAre you okay?\\nYeah.\\nHave either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?\\nOnly to make conversation.\\nAll right, so...\\nfive years ago, right before...\\nThanos...\\nI was in a place called the quantum realm.\\nThe quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.\\nTo get in there, you have to be incredibly small.\\nHope. She\\'s my...\\nShe was my...\\nShe was supposed to pull me out.\\nAnd then Thanos happened...\\nand I got stuck in there.\\nI\\'m sorry, that must have been a very long five years.\\nYeah, but that\\'s just it.\\nIt wasn\\'t.\\nFor me, it was five hours.\\nSee, the rules of the quantum realm aren\\'t like they are up here.\\nEverything is unpredictable.\\nIs that anybody\\'s sandwich?\\nI\\'m starving.\\nScott.\\nWhat are you talking about?\\nSo...\\nwhat I\\'m saying is...\\ntime works differently in the quantum realm.\\nThe only problem is right now we don\\'t have a way to navigate it.\\nBut what if we did?\\nI can\\'t stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos...\\nand we could navigate it?\\nWhat if there was a way...\\nthat we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time...\\nbut then exit the quantum realm at another point in time?\\nLike...\\n- Like before Thanos. - Wait.\\nAre you talking about a time machine?\\nNo. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.\\nThis is more like a...\\nYeah. Like a time machine.\\nI know, it\\'s crazy. It\\'s crazy.\\nBut I can\\'t stop thinking about it. There\\'s got to be...\\nsome way...\\n- It\\'s crazy. - Scott.\\nI get emails from a raccoon...\\nso nothing sounds crazy anymore.\\nSo, who do we talk to about this?\\nChow time!\\nMaguna.\\nMorgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?\\n- Define \"lunch\" or be disintegrated. - Okay.\\nYou should not be wearing that, okay?\\nThat is part of a special anniversary gift I\\'m making for Mom.\\nThere you go. You thinking about lunch?\\nI can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.\\n- No. - That\\'s what you want.\\nHow did you find this?\\n- Garage. - Really?\\n- Were you looking for it? - No.\\nI found it, though.\\nYou like going in the garage, huh?\\nSo does Daddy.\\nIt\\'s fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.\\nSo, I\\'m gonna...\\nNo. We know what it sounds like.\\nTony, after everything you\\'ve seen, is anything really impossible?\\nQuantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale...\\nwhich then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?\\nThank you.\\nIn layman\\'s terms, it means you\\'re not coming home.\\n- I did. - No.\\nYou accidentally survived.\\nIt\\'s a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.\\nAnd now you wanna pull a... What do you call it?\\nA time heist?\\nYeah, a time heist. Of course. Why didn\\'t we think of this before?\\nOh, because it\\'s laughable. Because it\\'s a pipe dream.\\nThe stones are in the past. We could go back, we could get them.\\nWe can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.\\nOr screw it up worse than he already has, right?\\nI don\\'t believe we would.\\nGotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.\\nHowever, high hopes won\\'t help...\\nif there\\'s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist.\\nI believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise.\\nNot if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.\\nAll right? It means no talking to our past selves...\\nno betting on sporting events.\\nI\\'m gonna stop you right there, Scott.\\nAre you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe...\\nis based on Back to the Future?\\n- Is it? - No.\\nGood. You had me worried there. \\'Cause that would be horseshit.\\nThat\\'s not how quantum physics works.\\nTony.\\nWe have to take a stand.\\nWe did stand. And yet, here we are.\\nI know you got a lot on the line.\\nYou got a wife, a daughter.\\nBut I lost someone very important to me.\\nA lotta people did.\\nAnd now, now we have a chance to bring her back...\\nto bring everyone back, and you\\'re telling me that you won\\'t even...\\nThat\\'s right, Scott. I won\\'t even.\\nI can\\'t.\\nMommy told me to come and save you.\\nGood job. I\\'m saved.\\nI wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else.\\nI\\'m honestly happy to see you guys, I just...\\n- Oh, look, the table\\'s set for six. - Tony.\\nI get it.\\nAnd I\\'m happy for you. I really am.\\nBut this is a second chance.\\nI got my second chance right here, Cap.\\nCan\\'t roll the dice on it.\\nIf you don\\'t talk shop, you can stay for lunch.\\nWell, he\\'s scared.\\nHe\\'s not wrong.\\nYeah, but, I mean, what are we gonna do?\\nWe need him. What, are we gonna stop?\\nNo, I wanna do it right.\\nWe\\'re gonna need a really big brain.\\nBigger than his?\\nCome on, I feel like I\\'m the only one eating here. Try some of that.\\nHave some eggs.\\nI\\'m so confused.\\nThese are confusing times.\\nRight, no, no. That\\'s not what I meant.\\nNah, I get it. I\\'m kidding!\\nI know, it\\'s crazy.\\nI\\'m wearing shirts now.\\nYeah. What? How? Why?\\nFive years ago, we got our asses beat.\\nExcept it was worse for me...\\n\\'cause I lost twice.\\nFirst, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...\\nand then, we all lost.\\nNo one blamed you, Bruce.\\nI did.\\nFor years, I\\'ve been treating the Hulk like he\\'s some kind of disease...\\nsomething to get rid of.\\nBut then, I start looking at him as the cure.\\nEighteen months in the gamma lab.\\nI put the brains and the brawn together...\\nand now, look at me.\\nBest of both worlds.\\n- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.\\nCan we get a photo?\\n100%, little person.\\nCome on, step on up. Do you mind?\\n- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.\\nSay \"green.\"\\n- Green. - Green.\\nDid you get that?\\nThat\\'s a good one.\\nDid you want to grab one with me? I\\'m Ant-Man.\\nThey\\'re Hulk fans. They don\\'t know Ant-Man.\\nNobody does.\\n- No, he wants you to take a picture with him. - I don\\'t want a picture.\\nStranger danger.\\nYeah, look, he\\'s even saying no, he doesn\\'t.\\n- I get it. I don\\'t want it, either. - But come on. The kid...\\nI don\\'t want a picture with them.\\n- He\\'s gonna feel bad. - Sorry.\\nThey\\'re happy to do it. They said they\\'ll do it.\\n- I don\\'t want to do it. - We can do it.\\n- No, you feel bad. - Take the goddamn phone.\\nOkay.\\n- Thank you, Mr. Hulk. - No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.\\nHulk out!\\nBruce.\\nDab.\\n- Bruce. - Listen to your mom.\\nShe knows better.\\nAbout what we were saying.\\nRight.\\nThe whole time travel do-over?\\nGuys, it\\'s outside of my area of expertise.\\nWell, you pulled this off.\\nI remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.\\nI\\'ve got a mild inspiration. I\\'d like to see if it checks out.\\nSo, I\\'d like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night.\\nThis time, in the shape of a Mobius strip, inverted, please.\\nProcessing.\\nRight, give me the eigenvalue of that particle...\\nfactoring in spectral decomp.\\n- That\\'ll take a second. - Just a moment.\\nAnd don\\'t worry if it doesn\\'t pan out. I\\'m just kinda...\\nModel rendered.\\nShit!\\nShit!\\nWhat are you doing up, little miss?\\n- Shit. - Nope. We don\\'t say that.\\nOnly Mommy says that word.\\nShe coined it. It belongs to her.\\nWhy are you up?\\n\\'Cause I\\'ve got some important shit going on here!\\nWhy do you think?\\nNo, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.\\nWas it juice pops?\\nSure was.\\nThat\\'s extortion. That\\'s a word.\\nWhat kind you want?\\nGreat minds think alike.\\nJuice pops exactly...\\nwas on my mind.\\nYou done? Yeah?\\nNow you are.\\nHere. Wipe.\\nGood. That face goes there.\\nTell me a story.\\nA story.\\nOnce upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.\\nThat is a horrible story.\\nCome on, that\\'s your favorite story.\\nLove you tons.\\nI love you 3,000.\\nWow.\\n3,000.

And I can\\'t help everybody.\\nSorta seems like you can.\\nNot if I stop.\\nI can put a pin in it right now and stop.\\nTony...\\ntrying to get you to stop...\\nhas been one of the few failures of my entire life.\\nSomething tells me...\\nI should put it in a lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...\\nand go to bed.\\nBut would you be able to rest?\\nOkay, here we go. Time travel test number one.\\nScott, fire up...\\nthe van thing.\\nBreakers are set.\\nEmergency generators are on standby.\\nGood, because if we blow the grid, I don\\'t want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s.\\nExcuse me?\\nHe\\'s kidding.\\nYou can\\'t say things like that.\\nIt was a bad joke.\\nYou were kidding, right?\\nI have no idea. We\\'re talking about time travel here.\\nEither it\\'s all a joke, or none of it is.\\nWe\\'re good!\\nGet your helmet on.\\nScott, I\\'m gonna send you back a week...\\nlet you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds.\\nMake sense?\\nPerfectly not confusing.\\nGood luck, Scott. You got this.\\nYou\\'re right. I do, Captain America.\\nOn a count of three...\\nThree, two, one.\\nGuys?\\nThis doesn\\'t feel right.\\nWhat is this?\\n- What\\'s going on? - Who is that?\\n- Hold on. - Is that Scott?\\nYes, it\\'s Scott.\\n- What\\'s going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!\\n- What is this? - Hold on a second.\\n- Could I get a little space here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n- Can you bring him back? - I\\'m working on it.\\nIt\\'s a baby.\\n- It\\'s Scott. - As a baby.\\n- He\\'ll grow. - Bring Scott back.\\nWhen I say kill the power, kill the power.\\nOh, my God.\\nAnd... kill it!\\nSomebody peed my pants.\\nOh, thank God.\\nBut I don\\'t know if it was baby me or old me.\\nOr just me me.\\nTime travel!\\nWhat?\\nI see this as an absolute win.\\nWhy the long face?\\nLet me guess, he turned into a baby.\\nAmong other things, yeah. What are you doing here?\\nIt\\'s the EPR Paradox.\\nInstead of pushing Lang through time, you might\\'ve wound up...\\npushing time through Lang.\\nIt\\'s tricky, dangerous. Somebody could have cautioned you against it.\\nYou did.\\nOh, did I?\\nWell, thank God I\\'m here.\\nRegardless, I fixed it.\\nA fully functioning time-space GPS.\\nI just want peace.\\nTurns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.\\nMe, too.\\nWe got a shot at getting these stones, but I got to tell you my priorities.\\nBring back what we lost, I hope, yes.\\nKeep what I found, I have to, at all costs.\\nAnd maybe not die trying.\\nWould be nice.\\nSounds like a deal.\\nTony, I don\\'t know.\\nWhy?\\nHe made it for you.\\nPlus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.\\nThank you, Tony.\\nWill you keep that a little quiet?\\nDidn\\'t bring one for the whole team.\\nWe are getting the whole team, yeah?\\nWe\\'re working on that right now.\\nHey, Humie.\\nWhere\\'s Big Green?\\nThe kitchen, I think.\\nThat\\'s awesome.\\nRhodey, careful on re-entry.\\nThere\\'s an idiot in the landing zone.\\nOh, God.\\nWhat\\'s up, Regular-Sized Man?\\nKind of a step down from the golden palaces and the magic hammers and whatnot.\\nHey, have a little compassion, pal.\\nFirst, they lost Asgard, then half their people.\\nThey\\'re probably just happy to have a home.\\nYou shouldn\\'t have come.\\nValkyrie!\\nGreat to see you, angry girl!\\nI think I liked you better either of the other ways.\\n- This is Rocket. - How ya doing?\\nHe won\\'t see you.\\nIt\\'s that bad, huh?\\nWe only see him once a month when he comes in for \"supplies.\"\\nIt\\'s that bad.\\nYeah.\\nWhat the...?\\nSomething died in here!\\nHello? Thor!\\nAre you here about the cable?\\nThe Cinemax went out two weeks ago...\\nand the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.\\nThor?\\nBoys! Oh, my God!\\nOh, my God, it\\'s so good to see you!\\nCome here, cuddly little rascal.\\nYeah, no, I\\'m good. I\\'m good.\\nThat\\'s not necessary.\\nHulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?\\n- Hey, boys! - Hey, guys.\\nLong time no see.\\nBeer\\'s in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.\\nNo password, obviously.\\nThor, he\\'s back.\\nThat kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.\\nNoobmaster.\\nYeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.\\nI am sick of this.\\nNoobmaster, hey, it\\'s Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder.\\nListen, bud, if you don\\'t log off this game immediately...\\nI am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you\\'re hiding in...\\nrip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!\\nOh, that\\'s right, yes! Go cry to your father, you little weasel.\\nThank you, Thor.\\nLet me know if he bothers you again, okay?\\nThank you very much. I will.\\nSo, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking?\\nI\\'ve got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.\\nBuddy.\\nYou all right?\\nYes, I\\'m fine. Why?\\nWhy, don\\'t I look all right?\\nYou look like melted ice cream.\\nSo, what\\'s up? You just here for a hang, or what?\\nWe need your help.\\nThere might be a chance we could fix everything.\\nWhat, like the cable?\\n\\'Cause that\\'s been driving me bananas for weeks.\\nLike Thanos.\\nDon\\'t say that name.\\nYeah, we don\\'t actually say that name in here.\\nPlease take your hand off me.\\nNow, I know that guy...\\nmight scare you.\\nWhy would I be...?\\nWhy would I be scared of that guy?\\nI\\'m the one who killed that guy, remember?\\nAnyone else here kill that guy?\\nNope.\\nDidn\\'t think so.\\nKorg, why don\\'t you tell everybody who chopped Thanos\\' big head off?\\nStormbreaker?\\nWho was swinging Stormbreaker?\\nI get it. You\\'re in a rough spot, okay?\\nI\\'ve been there myself.\\nAnd you want to know who helped me out of it?\\nWas it Natasha?\\nIt was you.\\nYou helped me.\\nSo, why don\\'t you ask...\\nthe Asgardians down there...\\nhow much my help is worth?\\nThe ones that are left, anyway.\\nI think we could bring them back.\\nStop.\\nStop, okay?\\nI know you think I\\'m down here wallowing in my own self-pity...\\nwaiting to be rescued and saved...\\nbut I\\'m fine, okay. We\\'re fine, aren\\'t we?\\nWe\\'re good here, mate.\\nSo, whatever it is that you\\'re offering, we\\'re not into it.\\nDon\\'t care. Couldn\\'t care less.\\nGoodbye.\\nWe need you, pal.\\nThere\\'s beer on the ship.\\nWhat kind?\\nIt\\'s him! He\\'s after Akihiko!\\nWhy are you doing this?\\nWe never did anything to you!\\nYou survived...\\nHalf the planet didn\\'t.\\nThey got Thanos.\\nYou get me...\\nYou\\'re done hurting people.\\nWE hurt people?\\nYou\\'re crazy!\\nWait! Help me!\\nI\\'ll give you anything!\\nWhat do you want?\\nWhat I want you can\\'t give me.\\nYou shouldn\\'t be here.\\nNeither should you.\\nI\\'ve got a job to do.\\nIs that what you\\'re calling this?\\nKilling all these people isn\\'t gonna bring your family back.\\nWe found something.\\nA chance, maybe.\\nDon\\'t.\\nDon\\'t what?\\nDon\\'t give me hope.\\nI\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t give it to you sooner.\\nYou\\'re drifting left.\\nOne side there, Lebowski.\\nRatchet, how\\'s it going?\\nIt\\'s Rocket.\\nTake it easy. You\\'re only a genius on Earth, pal.\\nTime travel suit, not bad.\\nHey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy!\\nI\\'m being very careful.\\nNo, you\\'re being very Hulky.\\nI\\'m being careful.\\nThese are Pym Particles, all right?\\nAnd ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it.\\nThis is what we have. We\\'re not making any more.\\n- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.\\nWe\\'ve got enough for one round-trip each. That\\'s it.\\nNo do-overs.\\nPlus two test runs.\\nOne test run.\\nAll right. I\\'m not ready for this.\\nI\\'m game.\\nI\\'ll do it.\\nClint, now you\\'re gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift.\\n- Don\\'t worry about that. - Wait a second. Let me ask you something.\\nIf we can do this, you know...\\ngo back in time, why don\\'t we just find baby Thanos?\\nYou know, and...\\n- First of all, that\\'s horrible. - It\\'s Thanos.\\nAnd secondly, time doesn\\'t work that way.\\nChanging the past doesn\\'t change the future.\\nLook, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them...\\nThanos doesn\\'t have the stones. Problem solved.\\n- Bingo. - That\\'s not how it works.\\n- Well, that\\'s what I heard. - Wait, but who? Who told you that?\\nStar Trek, Terminator, Timecop...\\n- Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.\\n- Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time. - Hot Tub Time Machine.\\nHot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted\\'s Excellent Adventure.\\nBasically, any movie that deals with time travel.\\nDie Hard. No, that\\'s not one.\\nThis is known.\\nI don\\'t know why everyone believes that, but that isn\\'t true.\\nThink about it. If you travel to the past...\\nthat past becomes your future...\\nand your former present becomes the past...\\nwhich can\\'t now be changed by your new future.\\nExactly.\\nSo Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?\\nAll right, Clint.\\nWe\\'re going in three, two...\\none.\\nCooper?\\nWhere are my headphones?\\nLila?\\n- I never had them. - Lila?\\nYeah, you had them yesterday!\\nLila! Lila!\\nYeah, Dad?\\nDad?\\nLila!\\nHey. Hey, look at me.\\nYou okay?\\nYeah. Yeah.\\nIt worked.\\nIt worked.\\nOkay, so the how works.\\nNow, we got to figure out the when and the where.\\nAlmost everyone in this room has had an encounter...\\nwith at least one of the six Infinity Stones.\\nOr substitute the word \"encounter\"...\\nfor \"damn near been killed\" by one of the six Infinity Stones.\\nWell, I haven\\'t...\\nbut I don\\'t even know what the hell you\\'re all talking about.\\nRegardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round-trip each.\\nAnd these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.\\nOur history.\\nSo, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?\\nWhich means we have to pick our targets.\\nCorrect.\\nSo, let\\'s start with the Aether.\\nThor, what do you know?\\nIs he asleep?\\nNo, no. I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s dead.\\nWhere to start?\\nThe Aether, firstly, is not a stone.\\nSomeone called it a stone before.\\nIt\\'s more of an angry sludge sort of a thing...\\nso someone\\'s gonna need to amend that and stop saying that.\\nHere\\'s an interesting story, though, about the Aether.\\nMy grandfather, many years ago...\\nhad to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.\\nScary beings.\\nSo, Jane, actually...\\nOh, there she is.\\nYeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.\\nYou know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...\\nand then the Aether stuck itself inside her...\\nand she became very, very sick.\\nAnd so I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I\\'m from...\\nand we had to try and fix her.\\nWe were dating at the time, you see...\\nand I got to introduce her to my mother...\\nwho\\'s dead and...\\nOh, you know, Jane and I aren\\'t even dating anymore, so...\\nYes, these things happen, though. You know?\\nNothing lasts forever. The only thing that...\\n- Why don\\'t you come sit down? - I\\'m not done yet.\\nThe only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence.\\nAwesome. Eggs? Breakfast?\\nNo. I\\'d like a Bloody Mary.\\nQuill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.\\n- Is that a person? - No, Morag\\'s a planet.\\nQuill was a person.\\nLike a planet? Like in outer space?\\nOh, look. It\\'s like a little puppy, all happy and everything.\\nDo you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?\\nI\\'ll take you to space.\\nThanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.\\nWhat is Vormir?\\nA dominion of death...\\nat the very center of celestial existence.\\nIt\\'s where Thanos murdered my sister.\\nNot it.\\n- That Time Stone guy. - Doctor Strange.\\nYeah, what kind of doctor was he?\\nEar-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.\\nNice place in the Village, though.\\nYeah, on Sullivan Street?\\nBleecker Street.\\nWait, he lived in New York?\\n- No, he lived in Toronto. - Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.\\n- Have you been listening to anything? - Guys.\\nIf you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.\\nShut the front door.\\nAll right. We have a plan.\\nSix stones, three teams, one shot.\\nFive years ago, we lost.\\nAll of us.\\nWe lost friends.\\nWe lost family.\\nWe lost a part of ourselves.\\nToday, we have a chance to take it all back.\\nYou know your teams. You know your missions.\\nGet the stones. Get them back.\\nOne round-trip each.\\nNo mistakes...\\nno do-overs.\\nMost of us are going somewhere we know.\\nThat doesn\\'t mean we should know what to expect.\\nBe careful.\\nLook out for each other.\\nThis is the fight of our lives...\\nand we\\'re gonna win.\\nWhatever it takes.\\nGood luck.\\nHe\\'s pretty good at that.\\n- Right? - All right.\\nYou heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.\\nTrackers engaged.\\nYou promise to bring that back in one piece, right?\\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\\nOkay, I\\'ll do my best.\\nAs promises go, that was pretty lame.\\nSee ya in a minute.\\nAll right, we all have our assignments.\\nTwo stones uptown, one stone down.\\nStay low. Keep an eye on the clock.\\nMaybe smash a few things along the way.\\nI think it\\'s gratuitous, but whatever.\\nI\\'d be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.\\nYeah, I\\'m looking for Doctor Strange.\\nYou\\'re about five years too early.\\nStephen Strange is currently performing surgery about 20 blocks that way.\\nWhat do you want from him?\\nThat, actually.\\nI\\'m afraid not.\\nSorry, but I wasn\\'t asking.\\nYou don\\'t want to do this.\\nYou\\'re right, I don\\'t. But I need that stone...\\nand I don\\'t have time to debate it.\\nLet\\'s start over, shall we?\\nFor you, Lady Jane.\\nDo you have anything with pants?\\nPants?\\nNever mind. These will be fine. Thank you.\\n- Yes, milady. - There\\'s Jane.\\nAll right.\\nHere\\'s the deal, tubby.\\nYou\\'re gonna charm her, and I\\'m gonna poke her with this thing...\\nand extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.\\nI\\'ll be right back, okay? The wine cellar is just down here.\\nMy father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.\\nI\\'ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.\\nHey. Hey! Aren\\'t you drunk enough already?\\n- If you could send Loki some soup. - Yes, milady.\\nAnd ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.\\nWho\\'s the fancy broad?\\nThat\\'s my mother.\\nShe dies today.\\nOh, that is today?\\nI can\\'t do this. I can\\'t do this.\\nI shouldn\\'t be here. I shouldn\\'t have come.\\nIt\\'s a bad idea!\\n- Come here. - No, no, no.\\nI think I\\'m having a panic attack.\\n- Come here. Right here. - I shouldn\\'t be here. This is bad.\\nYou think you\\'re the only one who lost people?\\nWhat do you think we\\'re doing here?\\nI lost the only family I ever had.\\nQuill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...\\nall gone.\\nI get you miss your mom...\\nbut she\\'s gone.\\nReally gone.\\nAnd there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...\\nand you can help them.\\nSo, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...\\nmake schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...\\nand when she\\'s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...\\nand help me get my family back?\\nOkay.\\nAre you crying?\\nNo.\\nYes.\\nI feel like I\\'m losing it.\\nGet it together!\\nYou can do this.\\nYou can do this.\\nAll right?\\nYes, I can.\\nGood.\\nI can do this. I can do this.\\nI can\\'t do this.\\nAll right, heartbreaker, she\\'s alone. This is our shot.\\nThor? Thor!\\nAll right, bring it down, Blue.\\nRight on that line. That\\'s it. Down, down.\\nHey, can we hurry it up?\\nGuys, chop-chop. Come on. We\\'re on the clock.\\nAll that is really helpful.\\n- Take care, okay? - Yeah.\\nGet that stone and come back. No messing around.\\n- Hey. - We got this.\\n- Let\\'s get it done. - Yes, sir.\\nI\\'ll see you back.\\nYou guys watch each other\\'s six.\\nYeah.\\nCoordinates for Vormir are laid in.\\nAll they have to do is not fall out.\\nWe\\'re a long way from Budapest.\\nOkay, so...\\nwe just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...\\nand then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?\\nLet\\'s take cover.\\nWe\\'re not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.\\nWait a minute. What are you talking about right now?\\nWho else is looking for these stones?\\nMy father...\\nmy sister...\\nand me.\\nAnd you?\\nWhere are you right now?\\nYou\\'re welcome.\\nI didn\\'t ask for your help.\\nAnd yet, you always need it.\\nGet up. Father wants us back on the ship.\\nWhy?\\nHe\\'s found an Infinity Stone.\\nWhere?\\nOn a planet called Morag.\\nFather\\'s plan is finally in motion.\\nOne stone isn\\'t six, Nebula.\\nIt\\'s a start.\\nIf he gets all of them...\\nRonan\\'s located the Power Stone. I\\'m dispatching you to his ship.\\nHe won\\'t like that.\\nHis alternative is death.\\nRonan\\'s obsession...\\nclouds his judgment.\\nWe will not fail you, Father.\\nNo, you won\\'t.\\nI swear...\\nI will make you proud.\\nWe just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...\\nand then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?\\nLet\\'s take cover.\\nWe\\'re not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.\\nWho was that?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nMy head is splitting. I don\\'t know.\\nHer synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.\\nBring her to my ship.\\nBetter hustle, Cap.\\nThings look like they\\'re just about wrapped up here.\\nGot it. I\\'m approaching the elevator now.\\nIf it\\'s all the same to you...\\nI\\'ll have that drink now.\\nAll right, get him on his feet.\\nWe can all stand around posing up a storm later.\\nBy the way, feel free to clean up.\\nMr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...\\ndid nothing for your ass.\\nNo one asked you to look, Tony.\\n- It\\'s ridiculous. - I think you look great, Cap.\\nAs far as I\\'m concerned, that\\'s America\\'s ass.\\nWho gets the magic wand?\\nS.T.R.I.K.E. team\\'s coming to secure it.\\nWe can take that off your hands.\\nBy all means.\\nCareful with that thing.\\nYeah, unless you want your mind erased.\\nAnd not in a fun way.\\nWe promise to be careful.\\nWho are these guys?\\nThey are S.H.I.E.I.D.\\nWell, actually Hydra, but we didn\\'t know that yet.\\nSeriously? You didn\\'t?\\nI mean, they look like bad guys.\\nYou\\'re small, but you\\'re talking loud.\\nOn my way down to coordinate search and rescue.\\nOn my way down to coordinate search and rescue.\\nI mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?\\nShut up.\\nAll right, you\\'re up, little buddy.\\nThere\\'s our stone.\\nAll right.\\nFlick me.\\n- Move. - Hey.\\nHey, hey. Buddy!\\nWhat do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.\\nTake the stairs.\\nYeah. Stop, stop.\\n\"Take the stairs.\" Hate the stairs.\\nAll right, Cap, I got our scepter in the elevator...\\njust passing the 80th floor.\\nOn it.\\n- Head to the lobby. - All right, I\\'ll see you there.\\nEvidence secure.\\nWe\\'re en route to Doctor List.\\nNo. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.\\nCaptain.\\nI thought you were coordinating search and rescue.\\nChange of plans.\\nHey, Cap.\\nRumlow.\\nI just got a call from the secretary.\\nI\\'m gonna be running point on the scepter.\\nSir? I don\\'t understand.\\nWe got word there may be an attempt to steal it.\\nSorry, Cap.\\nWe can\\'t give you the scepter.\\nI\\'m gonna have to call the director.\\nThat\\'s okay. Trust me.\\nHail Hydra.\\nSo many stairs!\\nThumbelina, do you copy? I\\'ve got eyes on the prize.\\nIt is go time.\\nBombs away.\\nIs that Axe Body Spray?\\nYeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Relax.\\nCan we focus, please?\\nI\\'m going inside you...\\nnow.\\nMay I ask you where you\\'re going?\\nBit of lunch and then Asgard. I\\'m sorry, you are...?\\nAlexander Pierce.\\nHe\\'s the man above the folks behind Nick Fury.\\nMy friends call me Mr. Secretary.\\nI\\'m gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.\\nLoki will be answering to Odin himself.\\nNo, he\\'s going to answer to us. Odin can have what\\'s left.\\nAnd I\\'m gonna need that case.\\nThat\\'s been S.H.I.E.I.D. property for over 70 years.\\nHand over the case, Stark.\\nAll right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here. Let\\'s go.\\nI\\'m not gonna argue who\\'s got the higher authority here...\\nYou promise me you won\\'t die?\\nWe\\'re only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.\\nThat doesn\\'t sound mild.\\nI need the case.\\nI know you got a lot of pull, I\\'m just saying, jurisdiction...\\nOkay, then give me the case.\\n- Well, jurisdiction... - Hand it over.\\nDo it, Lang!\\n- Get your hands off me. - Window\\'s closing. Pull my pin.\\nHere goes!\\n- Stark? - Stark?\\nHe\\'s convulsing. Give him air!\\n- Medic! - Medic!\\nGive these guys some help.\\nSpeak to me.\\nStark, is it your chest machine?\\nBreathe, breathe.\\nGood job. Meet me in the alley. I\\'m gonna grab a quick slice.\\nNo stairs!\\nCome on, Stark, stay with us.\\nI\\'m going to try something. Okay? I have no idea if it\\'s going to work.\\nYes!\\nOh, that worked a treat.\\nDude, that was so crazy.\\nI had no idea if that was gonna work.\\n- The case. - The case is...\\nWhere\\'s the case? Where\\'s Loki?\\nLoki!\\nThat wasn\\'t supposed to happen, was it?\\nWe blew it.\\nLoki?\\nTony, what\\'s going on?\\nTell me you found that Cube.\\nYou got to be shitting me.\\nI have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.\\nI\\'m not Loki...\\nand I don\\'t wanna hurt you.\\nI can do this all day.\\nYeah, I know.\\nI know.\\nWhere did you get this?\\nBucky is alive.\\nWhat?\\nThat is America\\'s ass.\\nPlease, please.\\nI\\'m sorry, I can\\'t help you, Bruce.\\nIf I give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I\\'m dooming my own.\\nWith all due respect, all right...\\nI\\'m not sure the science really supports that.\\nThe Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time.\\nRemove one of the stones...\\nand that flow splits.\\nNow, this may benefit your reality...\\nbut my new one, not so much.\\nIn this new branch reality...\\nwithout our chief weapon against the forces of darkness...\\nour world would be overrun.\\nMillions will suffer.\\nSo, tell me, Doctor.\\nCan your science prevent all that?\\nNo...\\nbut we can erase it.\\nBecause once we\\'re done with the stones...\\nwe can return each one to its own timeline...\\nat the moment it was taken.\\nSo, chronologically...\\nin that reality...\\nit never left.\\nYes, but you\\'re leaving out the most important part.\\nIn order to return the stones, you have to survive.\\nWe will. I will. I promise.\\nI can\\'t risk this reality on a promise.\\nIt\\'s the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.\\nThen why the hell did Strange give it away?\\nWhat did you say?\\nStrange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.\\n- Willingly? - Yes.\\n- Why? - I have no idea.\\nMaybe he made a mistake.\\nOr I did.\\nStrange is meant to be the best of us.\\nSo, he must\\'ve done it for a reason.\\nI fear you might be right.\\nThank you.\\nI\\'m counting on you, Bruce.\\nWe all are.\\nRun diagnostics.\\nShow me her memory file.\\nSire, the file appears entangled.\\nIt was a memory, but not hers.\\nThere\\'s another consciousness...\\nsharing her network.\\nAnother Nebula.\\nImpossible.\\nThis duplicate carries a time stamp...\\nfrom nine years in the future.\\nWhere is this other Nebula?\\nIn our solar system on Morag.\\nCan you access her?\\nYes, the two are linked.\\nSearch the duplicate\\'s memories...\\nfor Infinity Stones.\\nAnd these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.\\nOur history.\\nSo, not a lot of convenient spots...\\nto just drop in.\\nWhich means we have to pick our targets.\\n- Correct. - Freeze image.\\nTerrans.\\nAvengers.\\nUnruly wretches.\\nWhat\\'s that reflection?\\nAmplify this, Maw.\\nI don\\'t understand.\\nTwo Nebulas.\\nNo. The same Nebula...\\nfrom two different times.\\nSet course for Morag.\\nAnd scan the duplicate\\'s memories.\\nI wanna see everything.\\nMy ladies, I\\'ll see you after. I\\'ll see you after. Go on ahead.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nOh, God!\\nYou\\'re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.\\nNo, I wasn\\'t sneaking. I was just going for a walk.\\nWhat are you wearing?\\nI always wear this. It\\'s one of my favorites.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with your eye?\\nOh, my eye.\\nRemember the Battle of Harokin...\\nwhen I got hit in the face with the broadsword?\\nYou\\'re not the Thor I know at all, are you?\\nYes, I am.\\nThe future hasn\\'t been kind to you, has it?\\nI didn\\'t say I was from the future.\\nI was raised by witches, boy.\\nI see with more than eyes, you know that.\\nYeah, I\\'m totally from the future.\\nYes, you are, honey.\\nI really need to talk to you.\\nWe can talk.\\nHis head was over there...\\nand his body over there...\\nI mean, what was the point? I was too late.\\nI was just standing there.\\nSome idiot with an axe.\\nNow, you\\'re no idiot.\\nYou\\'re here, aren\\'t you?\\nSeeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.\\nI am. Yes.\\nIdiot, no.\\nA failure?\\nAbsolutely.\\nThat\\'s a little bit harsh.\\nDo you know what that makes you?\\nJust like everyone else.\\nI\\'m not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?\\nEveryone fails at who they\\'re supposed to be, Thor.\\nThe measure of a person, of a hero...\\nis how well they succeed at being who they are.\\nI\\'ve really missed you, Mom.\\nThor! I got it!\\nGet that rabbit!\\nMom, I have to tell you something.\\nNo, son, you don\\'t.\\nYou\\'re here to repair your future, not mine.\\nThis is about your future.\\nIt\\'s none of my business.\\nHi.\\nYou must be Mom.\\nI got the thing.

It\\'s not, I could never...\\nI would never betray you.\\nNever. Never.\\nI know.\\nAnd you\\'ll have the chance to prove it.\\nNo!\\nHe knows!\\nBarton!

Give me a break, Steve.\\nI just got hit in the head with the Hulk.\\nYou said that we had one shot.\\nThis was our shot.\\nWe shot it. It\\'s shot. Six stones or nothing.\\n- It was six stones or nothing. - You\\'re repeating yourself, you know that?\\nYou\\'re repeating yourself.\\nYou\\'re repeating yourself. You\\'re repeating yourself.\\n- Dude. Come on! - No. You never wanted a time heist.\\nYou weren\\'t on board with the time heist.\\n- I dropped the ball. - You ruined the time heist.\\n- Is that what I did? - Yeah.\\nAre there any other options with the Tesseract?\\nNo, no, no, there\\'s no other options.\\nThere\\'s no do-overs.\\nWe\\'re not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.\\nEach.\\nThat\\'s it. All right? We use that...\\nbye-bye, you\\'re not going home.\\nYeah, well, if we don\\'t try...\\nthen no one else is going home, either.\\nI got it.\\nThere\\'s another way to retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles.\\nLittle stroll down memory lane.\\nMilitary installation, Garden State.\\nWhen were they both there?\\nThey were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea.\\n- How vague? - What are you talking about?\\nWhere are we going?\\nI know for a fact they were there.\\n- Who\\'s they? What are we doing? - And I know how I know.\\nGuys, what is it?\\nLooks like we\\'re improvising.\\n- Great. - What are we improvising?\\nScott, get this back to the compound.\\nSuit up.\\n- What\\'s in New Jersey? - 0-4.\\n0-4.\\n- 0-7. - 0-7.\\n- Excuse me. - 1-9-7-0.\\nAre you sure?\\nCap?

Make love, not war.\\nClearly you weren\\'t actually born here, right?\\nThe idea of me was.\\nRight. Well, imagine you\\'re S.H.I.E.I.D...\\nrunning a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization...\\nwhere do you hide it?\\nIn plain sight.\\nGood luck on your mission, Captain.\\nGood luck on your project, Doctor.\\nYou new here?\\nNot exactly.\\nCome on, you bastard.\\nGotcha.\\nBack in the game.\\nArnim, you in there?\\nArnim?\\nHey!\\nThe door is this way, pal.\\nOh, yeah.\\nLooking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?\\nYeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven\\'t seen a soul.\\nPardon me.\\nDo I know you?\\nNo, sir.\\nI\\'m a visitor from MIT.\\nMIT.\\nGot a name?\\nHoward.\\n- That\\'ll be easy to remember. - Howard...\\nPotts.\\nWell, I\\'m Howard Stark.\\nHi.\\nShake that, don\\'t pull it.\\nYeah.\\nYou look a little green around the gills, there, Potts.\\nI\\'m fine. Just long hours.\\nYou wanna get some air?\\n- Hello, Potts. - Yeah.\\n- That\\'d be swell. - That way.\\nOkay.\\nNeed your briefcase?\\nYou\\'re not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts?\\n- Hello? - Doctor Pym?\\nThat would be the number that you called, yes.\\nThis is Captain Stevens from shipping.\\nWe have a package for you.\\nBring it up.\\nThat\\'s the thing, sir, we can\\'t.\\nI\\'m confused. I thought that was your job.\\nWell, it\\'s just...\\nSir, the box is glowing...\\nand to be honest, some of our mail guys aren\\'t feeling that great.\\nThey didn\\'t open it, did they?\\nYeah, they did. You better get down here.\\nExcuse me! Out of the way!\\nSo, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?\\nMy wife\\'s expecting.\\nAnd too much time at the office.\\nCongratulations.\\n- Thanks. Hold this, will ya? - Yeah, sure.\\n- How far along is she? - I don\\'t know.\\nShe\\'s at the point where she can\\'t stand the sound of my chewing.\\nI guess I\\'ll be eating dinner in the pantry again.\\nI have a little girl.\\nA girl would be nice.\\nLess of a chance she\\'d turn out exactly like me.\\nWhat\\'d be so awful about that?\\nLet\\'s just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.\\nAnd you\\'ve never seen these two men before?\\nNo, I\\'ve got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.\\n- Can you describe them? - One of them had a hippie beard.\\nHippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?\\nDefinitely Mungo Jerry.\\nYeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MP to sublevel six.\\nWe have a potential breach.\\nI said bring them in.\\nThey\\'re trying, ma\\'am, but Braddock\\'s unit has been stopped by lightning strikes.\\nOh, for the love of...\\nI\\'ll look at the weather projections.\\nIt\\'s not lightning strikes we\\'re looking at.\\nSo, where you at with names?\\nWell, if it\\'s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.\\nMight wanna let that stew awhile. You got time.\\nLet me ask you a question.\\nWhen your kid was born, were you nervous?\\nWildly.\\n- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?\\nLike you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?\\nI literally pieced it together as I went along.\\nI thought about what my dad did.\\nMy old man, he never met a problem he couldn\\'t solve with a belt.\\nI thought my dad was tough on me.\\nAnd now, looking back on it, I just remember the good stuff.\\nYou know? He did drop the odd pearl.\\nYeah? Like what?\\n\"No amount of money ever bought a second of time.\"\\nSmart guy.\\nHe did his best.\\nI\\'ll tell you, that kid\\'s not even here yet and there\\'s nothing I wouldn\\'t do for him.\\nGood to meet you, Potts.\\nYeah.\\nHoward...\\neverything\\'s gonna be all right.\\nThank you...\\nfor everything...\\nyou\\'ve done for this country.\\nJarvis.\\nHave we ever met that guy?\\nYou meet a lot of people, sir.\\nSeems very familiar.\\nWeird beard.\\nYou\\'re weak.\\nI\\'m you.\\nYou could stop this.\\nYou know you want to.\\nDid you see what happens in the future?\\nThanos finds the Soul Stone.\\nYou wanna know how he does that?\\nYou wanna know what he does to you?\\nThat\\'s enough.\\nYou disgust me.\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re useless.\\nHow do I look?\\nWow.\\nUnder different circumstances...\\nthis would be totally awesome.\\nI bet the raccoon didn\\'t have to climb a mountain.\\nTechnically he\\'s not a raccoon, you know?\\nWhatever. He eats garbage.\\nWelcome.\\nNatasha.\\nDaughter of Ivan.\\nClint.\\nSon of Edith.\\nWho are you?\\nConsider me a guide...\\nto you...\\nand to all who seek the Soul Stone.\\nOh, good.\\nYou tell us where it is, then we\\'ll be on our way.\\nIf only it were that easy.\\nWhat you seek lies in front of you.\\nAs does what you fear.\\nThe stone\\'s down there.\\nFor one of you.\\nFor the other...\\nIn order to take the stone...\\nyou must lose that which you love.\\nAn everlasting exchange.\\nA soul for a soul.\\nHow\\'s it going?\\nJesus.\\nMaybe he\\'s making this shit up.\\nNo.\\nI don\\'t think so.\\nWhy? \\'Cause he knows your daddy\\'s name?\\nI didn\\'t.\\nThanos left here with the stone...\\nwithout his daughter.\\nThat\\'s not a coincidence.\\nYeah.\\nWhatever it takes.\\nWhatever it takes.\\nIf we don\\'t get that stone...\\nbillions of people stay dead.\\nYeah.\\nThen I guess we both know who it\\'s got to be.\\nI guess we do.\\nI\\'m starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha.\\nFor the last five years, I\\'ve been trying to do one thing.\\nGet to right here.\\nThat\\'s all it\\'s been about. Bringing everybody back.\\nNo, don\\'t you get all decent on me now.\\nWhat, you think I wanna do it?\\nI\\'m trying to save your life, you idiot.\\nYeah, well, I don\\'t want you to. How\\'s that?\\nNatasha, you know what I\\'ve done.\\nYou know what I\\'ve become.\\nI don\\'t judge people on their worst mistakes.\\nMaybe you should.\\nYou didn\\'t.\\nYou\\'re a pain in my ass, you know that?\\nOkay.\\nYou win.\\nTell my family I love \\'em.\\nYou tell \\'em yourself.\\nDamn you.\\nWait.\\nLet me go.\\nNo.\\nNo. Please, no.\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nPlease.\\nNo!\\nDid we get \\'em all?\\nAre you telling me this actually worked?\\nClint, where\\'s Nat?\\nDo we know if she had family?\\nYeah.\\nUs.\\nWhat?\\n- What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.\\nYeah, no, you\\'re acting like she\\'s dead.\\nWhy are we acting like she\\'s dead? We have the stones, right?\\nAs long as we have the stones...\\nCap, we can bring her back. Isn\\'t that right?\\nSo, stop this shit. We\\'re the Avengers. Get it together.\\nCan\\'t get her back.\\nWhat\\'s he...? What?\\nIt can\\'t be undone.\\nIt can\\'t.\\nLook, I\\'m sorry, no offense, but you\\'re a very earthly being, okay?\\nAnd we\\'re talking about space magic.\\nAnd \"can\\'t\" seems very definitive. Don\\'t you think?\\nYeah, look, I know that I\\'m way outside my pay grade here.\\nBut she still isn\\'t here, is she?\\nNo, that\\'s my point.\\nIt can\\'t be undone.\\nOr that\\'s at least what the red, floating guy had to say.\\nMaybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?\\nGo grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.\\nIt was supposed to be me.\\nShe sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.\\nShe bet her life on it.\\nShe\\'s not coming back.\\nWe have to make it worth it.\\nWe have to.\\nWe will.\\nBoom!\\nAll right, the glove\\'s ready.\\nQuestion is, who\\'s gonna snap their freakin\\' fingers?\\n- I\\'ll do it. - Excuse me?\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nStop, stop. Slow down.\\nThor. Just wait.\\nWe haven\\'t decided who\\'s gonna put that on yet.\\nI\\'m sorry. What, we\\'re all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?\\nWe should at least discuss it.\\nLook, sitting here staring at the thing is not gonna bring everybody back.\\nI\\'m the strongest Avenger, okay? So, this responsibility falls upon me.\\n- Normally, you\\'re right. - It\\'s my duty.\\n- It\\'s not about that. - It\\'s not that.\\n- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.\\nJust let me do it.\\nJust let me do something good. Something right.\\nLook, it\\'s not just the fact...\\nthat that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent.\\nI\\'m telling you. You\\'re in no condition.\\nWhat do you think is coursing through my veins right now?\\nCheez Whiz?\\nLightning.\\n- Yeah. - Lightning.\\nLightning won\\'t help you, pal.\\nIt\\'s got to be me.\\nYou saw what those stones did to Thanos.\\nThey almost killed him.\\nNone of you could survive.\\nHow do we know you will?\\nWe don\\'t.\\nBut the radiation\\'s mostly gamma.\\nIt\\'s like...\\nI was made for this.\\nGood to go, yeah?\\nLet\\'s do it.\\nOkay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago...\\nyou\\'re just bringing them back to now, today.\\nDon\\'t change anything from the last five years.\\nGot it.\\nFriday, do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?\\nYes, boss.\\nEverybody comes home.\\nTake it off! Take it off!\\nNo, wait. Bruce, are you okay?\\nTalk to me, Banner.\\nI\\'m okay.\\nI\\'m okay.\\nBruce!\\nDon\\'t move him.\\n- Did it work? - We\\'re not sure. It\\'s okay.\\nHoney.\\nClint?\\nHoney.\\nGuys...\\nI think it worked.\\nI can\\'t breathe! I can\\'t breathe!\\nCanopy, canopy, canopy.\\nRhodey, Rocket, get out of here.\\nLet me up! Let me up!\\nCome on!\\nRhodey!\\nMayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy? We\\'re on the lower level. It\\'s flooding!\\nWhat? What?\\nWe are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!\\nWait! I\\'m here!\\nI\\'m here. Can you hear me?\\nCap?\\nOkay.\\nDaughter.\\nYes, Father.\\nSo, this is the future.\\nWell done.\\nThank you, Father.\\nThey suspected nothing.\\nThe arrogant never do.\\nGo.\\nFind the stones, bring them to me.\\nWhat will you do?\\nWait.\\nTell me something.\\nIn the future...\\nwhat happens to you and me?\\nI try to kill you.\\nSeveral times.\\nBut eventually...\\nwe become friends.\\nWe become sisters.\\nCome on.\\nWe can stop him.\\nCome on, buddy, wake up!\\nThat\\'s my man.\\nYou lose this again, I\\'m keeping it.\\nWhat happened?\\nYou mess with time, it tends to mess back.\\nYou\\'ll see.\\nWhat\\'s he been doing?\\nAbsolutely nothing.\\nWhere are the stones?\\nSomewhere under all this.\\nAll I know is he doesn\\'t have \\'em.\\nSo, we keep it that way.\\nYou know it\\'s a trap, right?\\nYeah.\\nI don\\'t much care.\\nGood.\\nJust as long as we\\'re all in agreement.\\nLet\\'s kill him properly this time.\\nYou could not live with your own failure.\\nWhere did that bring you?\\nBack to me.\\nI thought by eliminating half of life...\\nthe other half would thrive.\\nBut you\\'ve shown me...\\nthat\\'s impossible.\\nAnd as long as there are those that remember what was...\\nthere will always be those that are unable to accept what can be.\\nThey will resist.\\nYep, we\\'re all kinds of stubborn.\\nI\\'m thankful.\\nBecause now...\\nI know what I must do.\\nI will shred this universe...\\ndown to its last atom.\\nAnd then...\\nwith the stones you\\'ve collected for me...\\ncreate a new one...\\nteeming with life...\\nthat knows not what it has lost...\\nbut only what it has been given.\\nA grateful universe.\\nBorn out of blood.\\nThey\\'ll never know it.\\nBecause you won\\'t be alive to tell them.\\nSee you on the other side, man.\\nHang on! I\\'m coming!\\nYeah!\\nOh, hey.\\nI know you.\\nFather...\\nI have the stones.\\nWhat?\\nStop.\\nYou\\'re betraying us?\\nYou don\\'t have to do this.\\nI am this.\\nNo, you\\'re not.\\nYou\\'ve seen what we become.\\nNebula, listen to her.\\nYou can change.\\nHe won\\'t let me.\\nNo!\\nOkay, Thor. Hit me.\\nBoss, wake up!\\nI knew it!\\nIn all my years of conquest...\\nviolence...\\nslaughter...\\nit was never personal.\\nBut I\\'ll tell you now...\\nwhat I\\'m about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet...\\nI\\'m gonna enjoy it...\\nvery, very much.\\nHey, Cap, you read me?\\nCap, it\\'s Sam. Can you hear me?\\nOn your left.\\nIs that everyone?\\nWhat? You wanted more?\\nAvengers...\\nassemble.\\nDie!\\nNo, no, give me that. You have the little one.\\nHey!\\nHoly cow!\\nYou will not believe what\\'s been going on.\\nDo you remember when we were in space?\\nAnd I got all dusty?\\nAnd I must\\'ve passed out, because I woke up and you were gone.\\nBut Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...\\n\"It\\'s been five years. Come on, they need us.\"\\nAnd then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time.\\nHe did? Oh, no.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nThis is nice.\\nGamora?\\nI thought I lost you.\\nDon\\'t touch me!\\nYou missed the first time.\\nThen you got \\'em both the second time.\\nThis is the one?\\nSeriously?\\nYour choices were him or a tree.\\nCap!\\nWhat do you want me to do with this damn thing?\\nGet those stones as far away as possible!\\nNo!\\nWe need to get \\'em back where they came from.\\nNo way to get \\'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.\\nHold on!\\nThat wasn\\'t our only time machine.\\nAnyone see an ugly brown van out there?\\nYes! But you\\'re not gonna like where it\\'s parked!\\nScott, how long you need to get that thing working?\\nMaybe 10 minutes.\\nGet it started. We\\'ll get the stones to you.\\nWe\\'re on it, Cap.\\nHey.\\nYou said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?\\nTell me this is it.\\nIf I tell you what happens...\\nit won\\'t happen.\\nYou better be right.\\nIt\\'s a mess back here.\\nIt\\'s dead.\\n- What? - It\\'s dead.\\nI have to hot-wire it.\\nWhere\\'s Nebula?\\nShe\\'s not responding.\\nSire...\\nClint!\\nGive it to me.\\nYou took everything from me.\\nI don\\'t even know who you are.\\nYou will.\\nI got it!\\nActivate Instant Kill.\\nRain fire!\\nBut, sire, our troops!\\nJust do it!\\nIs anyone else seeing this?\\nI got this!\\nI got this. Okay, I don\\'t got this.\\nHelp, somebody help!\\nHey, Queens, heads up!\\nHang on. I got you, kid.\\nHey! Nice to meet you...\\nOh, my God!\\nWhat the hell is this?\\nFriday, what are they firing at?\\nSomething just entered the upper atmosphere.\\nOh, yeah!\\nDanvers, we need an assist here.\\nHi, I\\'m Peter Parker.\\nHey, Peter Parker.\\nYou got something for me?\\nI don\\'t know how you\\'re gonna get it through all of that.\\nDon\\'t worry.\\nShe\\'s got help.\\nI am inevitable.\\nAnd I...\\nam...\\nIron Man.\\nMr. Stark?\\nHey!\\nMr. Stark.

You did it, sir, you did it.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nTony.\\nHey.\\nHey, Pep.\\nFriday?\\nLife functions critical.\\nTony?\\nLook at me.\\nWe\\'re gonna be okay.\\nYou can rest now.\\nEverybody wants a happy ending, right?\\nBut it doesn\\'t always roll that way.\\nMaybe this time.\\nI\\'m hoping if you play this back...\\nit\\'s in celebration.\\nI hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.\\nAnd something like a normal version of the planet has been restored.\\nIf there ever was such a thing.\\nGod, what a world. Universe, now.\\nIf you told me 10 years ago that we weren\\'t alone...\\nlet alone to this extent, I mean, I wouldn\\'t have been surprised...\\nbut come on, who knew?\\nThe epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play.\\nAnd for better or worse...\\nthat\\'s the reality Morgan\\'s gonna have to find a way to grow up in.\\nSo, I thought I\\'d probably better record a little greeting...\\nin the case of an untimely death. On my part.\\nNot that death at any time isn\\'t untimely.\\nThis time travel thing that we\\'re gonna try and pull off tomorrow...\\nit\\'s got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.\\nThat\\'s the thing.\\nThen again, that\\'s the hero gig, right?\\nPart of the journey is the end.\\nWhat am I even tripping for?\\nEverything is gonna work out exactly the way it\\'s supposed to.\\nI love you 3,000.\\nYou know, I wish there was a way that I could let her know.\\nThat we won.\\nWe did it.\\nShe knows.\\nThey both do.\\nHow you doing, squirt?\\nGood.\\n- You good? - Mm-hmm.\\n- Good. You hungry? - Mm-hmm.\\nWhat do you want?\\nCheeseburgers.\\nYou know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.\\nOkay.\\nI\\'m gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.\\nOkay.\\nSo...\\nwhen can we expect you back?\\nAbout that...\\nThor, your people need a king.\\nNo, they already have one.\\nThat\\'s funny.\\nAre you being serious?\\nIt\\'s time for me to be who I am...\\nrather than who I\\'m supposed to be.\\nBut you, you\\'re a leader.\\nThat\\'s who you are.\\nYou know, I\\'d make a lot of changes around here.\\nI\\'m counting on it...\\nYour Majesty.\\nWhat will you do?\\nI\\'m not sure.\\nFor the first time in a thousand years, I have no path.\\nI do have a ride though.\\nMove it or lose it, hairbag.\\nHere we are!\\nTree, good to see you.\\nThe Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again.\\nWhere to first?\\nHey.\\nJust so you know, this is my ship still.\\nI\\'m in charge.\\nI know. I know. Of course you are.\\nOf course.\\nSee, you say, \"Of course,\" but then you touch the map.\\nIt makes you think that maybe you didn\\'t realize I was in charge.\\nQuail, that\\'s your own insecurities in there.\\nQuail?\\nOkay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting.\\nQuill.\\nThat\\'s what I said.\\nYou should fight one another for the honor of leadership.\\nSounds fair.\\n- It\\'s not necessary, okay? - It\\'s not.\\nI got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.\\nOh, yes! Please, use knives.\\nYeah. Knives.\\nI am Groot.\\nNot necessary.\\nThere shall be no knifing one another.\\nEverybody knows who\\'s in charge.\\nMe.\\nRight?\\nYes, you.\\nOf course! Of course.\\nOf course.\\nRemember...\\nyou have to return the stones to the exact moment you got \\'em...\\nor you\\'re gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.\\nDon\\'t worry, Bruce.\\nClip all the branches.\\nYou know, I tried.\\nWhen I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back.\\nI miss her, man.\\nMe too.\\nYou know, if you want, I could come with you.\\nYou\\'re a good man, Sam.\\nThis one\\'s on me, though.\\nDon\\'t do anything stupid till I get back.\\nHow can I?\\nYou\\'re taking all the stupid with you.\\nGonna miss you, buddy.\\nIt\\'s gonna be okay, Buck.\\nHow long is this gonna take?\\nFor him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds.\\nYou ready, Cap?\\nAll right, we\\'ll meet you back here, okay?\\nYou bet.\\nGoing quantum. Three...\\ntwo...\\none.\\nAnd returning in five...\\nfour...\\nthree, two...\\none.\\nWhere is he?\\nI don\\'t know. He blew right by his time stamp.\\nHe should be here.\\nGet him back.\\n- I\\'m trying. - Get him the hell back.\\n- Hey, I said I\\'m trying. - Sam.\\nGo ahead.\\nCap?\\nHi, Sam.\\nSo, did something go wrong or did something go right?\\nWell, after I put the stones back, I thought...\\nmaybe...\\nI\\'ll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.\\nHow\\'d that work out for ya?\\nIt was beautiful.\\nGood. I\\'m happy for you.\\nTruly.\\nThank you.\\nOnly thing bumming me out...\\nis the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.\\nThat reminds me.\\nTry it on.\\nHow does it feel?\\nLike it\\'s someone else\\'s.\\nIt isn\\'t.\\nThank you.\\nI\\'ll do my best.\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s yours.\\nYou wanna tell me about her?\\nNo.\\nNo, I don\\'t think I will.I still think about the night\\nyour mother and I had to leave you.\\nHopefully, it\\'s not for long,\\nbut I\\'ll call you when we get settled.\\nWhen I have a better indication of what\\'s going on.\\nMommy?\\nJellybean.\\nDaddy and I have a last-minute business trip...\\nso Rose is gonna stay with you for a few days.\\nNo. I don\\'t want you to go.\\nUgh. It\\'s gonna be so boring.\\nI won\\'t be able to keep my...\\neyes...\\nGoodbye, sweetheart. All right, we\\'ll see you soon.\\nOkay.\\nJanet, we gotta go.\\nI wish we could have put down our bags...\\ntucked you back into your bed...\\nbut too many lives were at stake.\\nOh, my God.\\nThey\\'ve already launched.\\nWe have to stop it.\\nCome on.\\nTo disarm the missile, we had to get inside it...\\nbut the plating was too thick.\\nThe only way in was to shrink between the molecules.\\nI can\\'t get through.\\nHank.\\nWe both knew that if you go that small...\\nthere is no coming back.\\nIt should have been me, but my regulator was damaged.\\nYour mother\\'s wasn\\'t.\\nTell Hope I love her.\\nShe turned it off.\\nJanet. No!\\nShe went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.\\nYour mother saved thousands of lives that day\\nknowing she\\'d be lost in the quantum realm.\\nAlone.\\nAfraid.\\nGone forever.\\nTelling you that she wasn\\'t coming home...\\nwas the hardest thing that I ever had to do.\\nBut then Scott showed up.\\nOr should I say, broke into our house.\\nAnd when he went to the quantum realm...\\nand came back.\\nEverything changed.\\nI started to wonder...\\ncould your mother still be alive?\\nSo, I dusted off some old plans.\\nDad, what are you saying?\\nI think it\\'s possible to bring her back.\\nOkay. We\\'re in.\\nOh, this place is a maze.\\nWhere\\'s that map?\\nWe\\'re definitely close.\\n- You ready? - I\\'m ready, Daddy.\\nAre you sure? \\'Cause once we\\'re inside,\\nyou show any hesitation or fear, we\\'re done.\\nI eat fear for breakfast.\\nWow.

It\\'s too important.\\nThis is the best birthday present you ever got me.\\nI\\'m so touched you think\\nI\\'m the world\\'s greatest grandma.\\nIt was the only one they had.\\nIt makes me want to knit you a sweater.\\nOh, no, the fuzz!\\nHey, Scotty...\\nI was looking at the schematics\\nfor the Karapetyan buildings...\\nand I think we have\\nway too many security cameras, don\\'t we?\\nNo, no, not at all.\\nI mean, \\'cause it\\'s a lot of security cameras.\\nI know what he needs.\\nWho\\'s the security expert in our business?\\nYou are, but I\\'m running the company, right?\\nAnd if we overquote him...\\nhe\\'s gonna go somewhere else.\\nI mean, we gotta land this bird.\\nHe ain\\'t goin\\' anywhere.\\nAnd the expression is \"land this fish.\"\\nNo, it\\'s \"land the bird.\"\\nJust like you land the plane.\\nYou gotta land the plane to be in business.\\nI know it\\'s silly to get hung up\\non these kinds of things, but I do.\\nHow am I gonna land a fish?\\nIt can\\'t walk. And if it swam up on shore...\\nand it battled a hawk, who\\'s gonna win?\\nYou\\'ve really turned me around on this thing.\\nIt\\'s okay. We\\'re gonna land Karapetyan.\\nNow, if you just excuse me...\\nI\\'m in the middle of trying to\\nsteal something with my daughter.\\nI\\'m gonna go recheck it.\\nTo the escape ant!\\nLet\\'s bounce before the po-po come back!\\nThe po-po? How do you even know that?\\nLet\\'s fly, Antoinette! Let\\'s fly!\\nCrash landing!\\nWhoo!\\nI wish we could shrink for real.\\nOh. That is pretty cool.\\nHey, I\\'m headed to the office, Scotty.\\nAnd sorry about freaking out earlier, you know.\\nBut I feel like I\\'m way better.\\nMy heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff.\\nAnd my hands are shaking.\\nBut I think it\\'s unrelated, you know?\\nIt\\'s gonna be great, Luis!\\nYou got nothing to worry about!\\nYeah, yeah. I\\'m the boss. I\\'m the boss.\\nI\\'m the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nDaddy!\\nCome on, Woo! I\\'ve got three days left.\\nWhy would I try to escape?\\nSorry, Scott, but rules are rules.\\nYou trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place.\\nKeel to stern, soup to nuts.\\nThank you.\\nIt was an accident. My foot went through the fence.\\nOur flying ant crashed.\\nHey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old\\nwhen you can\\'t leave the house.\\nYou know the lengths that I\\'ve gone to?\\nClose-up magic.\\nI learned that.\\nWhy can\\'t you just leave my daddy alone?\\nOh, Cassie.\\nThis must all seem like a bunch of confusing\\ngrown-up stuff to you, huh?\\nWell, think of it this way.\\nYour school has rules, right?\\nLike, you can\\'t draw on the walls.\\nWell, your daddy went to Germany\\nand drew on the walls with Captain America.\\nAnd that was a violation of Article 16,\\nParagraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.\\nNow, as a part of his joint plea deal...\\nwith Homeland Security and the German government...\\nhe was allowed to return to the U.S...\\nprovided he serve two years under house arrest...\\nfollowed by three years of probation.\\nAnd avoid any unauthorized activities, technology...\\nor contact with any former associates who were...\\nor currently are in violation of said Accords.\\nOr any related statutes.\\nOkay, sweetie?\\nWow. You\\'re really great with kids.\\nThanks. I\\'m also a youth pastor.\\nAnyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot...\\nbut you haven\\'t had any contact\\nwith Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?\\n- No. - You sure?\\nBecause it\\'s only a matter of time before we get \\'em.\\nIt was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too.\\nAnd associating with them breaks your deal.\\nAnd, uh, I don\\'t need to remind you...\\nthat any violation of your agreement\\nmeans 20 years in prison. Minimum.\\nI haven\\'t talked to Hank or Hope in forever.\\nThey hate his guts.\\nThanks, peanut.\\nHow\\'d you do it, Scott?\\nDo what?\\nThe card trick.\\nSeriously?\\nOh, my God!\\nYou people can\\'t just show up here\\nwhenever you want and search the place.\\nActually, they can.\\nYou need a warrant.\\nActually, they don\\'t.\\nReally? Wow.\\nDid you pack your soccer shoes?\\n- Yeah. - All right.\\nNext time I see you will be on the outside.\\nAll right.\\nOh, get on the inside of this.\\nHey, three days. Seriously...\\n- I\\'m proud of you, bud. - Thank you.\\nYou know what? Give me another one.\\nMe too! Gosh! Freedom!\\nNew business! I am sensing greatness.\\nI had a fun weekend, Daddy.\\nMe too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend.\\nOnce I\\'m outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red.\\nWe\\'ll have so much ice cream, we\\'ll never stop puking.\\nYou\\'re gettin\\' good at that.\\nHow\\'d you do that?\\n- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.\\n- Bye. - Bye.\\nThree days.\\nEasy-peasy.\\nSnap your fingers. That gets them to look over there.\\nAnd that is misdirection.\\nâª We had a dream\\nâª We\\'d go travelin\\' together\\nâª We\\'d spread a little lovin\\' then we\\'d keep movin\\' on âª\\nEasy-peasy.\\nWhere are you?\\nEverything that you know...\\nLost...\\nin the quantum realm.\\nWhat?\\nI\\'m gonna find you, Jellybean.\\nI found you!\\nYou always find me, Mommy.\\nWhat the hell?\\nHey, Hank! It\\'s been a while.\\nUm, I don\\'t even know if this is your number anymore.\\nAnd I\\'m probably the last person\\nyou wanna hear from.\\nBut I just had a really weird dream.\\nAnd I know that doesn\\'t\\nsound like an emergency or anything...\\nbut it just felt very real.\\nI was back in the quantum realm...\\nand I think I saw your wife.\\nAnd then I was your wife.\\nI mean, not in a weird way or anything.\\nYou know, hearing this out loud,\\nI\\'m thinking, uh, it\\'s not an emergency.\\nI\\'m sorry to bother you.\\nI\\'m sorry for a lot of things.\\nThat means, one tiny atom in my fingernail could be...\\nCould be one, little, tiny universe.\\nHope?\\nIs this another dream?\\nDo you think it was a dream...\\nor is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?\\nI\\'m not sure.\\nI can\\'t be here!\\nI can\\'t be here! I\\'m under house arrest!\\nThey won\\'t open while the system\\'s engaged, Scott.\\nYou have to take me home. They could show up any second!\\nRelax. As far as your nanny cops know,\\nyou\\'re still at home.\\nWhoa!\\nScotty?\\nHe\\'s programmed to replicate your daily routine.\\nNine hours in bed.\\nFive hours in front of the TV.\\nTwo hours in the bathroom, whatever that\\'s about.\\nThat\\'s totally inaccurate.\\nAnd how do you know about my daily routine?\\nAre you spying on me?\\nWe keep tabs on all security threats, all right?\\nAnd so far the biggest one we\\'ve had is you.\\nI\\'m sorry about Germany. They just showed up.\\nThey said it was a matter of national security.\\nThat Cap needed help, so...\\nCap?\\nTain America. Captain. Cap.\\nIt\\'s what we call him.\\nIf you\\'re a friend.\\nI\\'m not saying I\\'m a friend of... A little, I know him.\\nHe\\'s nice. Whatever.\\nI\\'m sorry! All right? I didn\\'t think I\\'d get caught.\\nYou didn\\'t think about a lot of things.\\nHow\\'s Hank?\\nWe\\'re still running. The house is gone, so is our freedom.\\nHow do you think he is?\\nI\\'m sorry. I know you\\'re mad.\\nI\\'m not looking for an apology, Scott.\\nThe only reason why we\\'re even talking is...\\nbecause we need what\\'s in your head.\\nIs this where you\\'re living?\\nIf you need help or money or something, maybe I can...\\nWe\\'re fine.\\nHey, Hank. Look, I just wanna...\\nSave it!\\n- Can we start? - Yeah.\\nSo, while you were relaxing at home...\\nwe were building this.\\nIt\\'s a tunnel. To the quantum realm.\\nTo my mom.\\nWe think she might still be down there.\\nWe just don\\'t know where.\\nWhat?\\nIf we can pinpoint my mom\\'s location...\\nthen the pod can take me down to get her.\\nYou built all this and you don\\'t even know\\nif she\\'s alive?\\nIt\\'s called a hypothesis.\\nLast night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time.\\nIt was overloaded and it shut down.\\nBut for a split second,\\nthe doorway to the quantum realm was opened.\\nAnd?\\nAnd five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom.\\nWe think when you were down there,\\nyou may have entangled with her.\\nHank, I would never do that. I respect you too much.\\nQuantum entanglement, Scott.\\nWe think she might have put\\nsome kind of a message in your head.\\nHopefully, a location.\\nAnd opening the tunnel triggered it.\\nYour mom put a message in my head?\\nCome on. That\\'s insane.\\nNo, Scott.\\nInsane is going to Germany\\nwithout telling us, and fighting the Avengers.\\nJust tell me you weren\\'t lying about the suit you took.\\nTell me you really destroyed it.\\nI did, I destroyed it, I swear.\\nI can\\'t believe you destroyed my suit!\\nThat was my life\\'s work!\\nWhat was I supposed to do?\\nYou were supposed to not take my suit!\\nI\\'m sorry, Hank!\\nI\\'m sorry I took the suit.\\nI\\'m sorry that I called last night.\\nI don\\'t remember seeing Janet down there.\\nI wish that I did.\\nI just had a dream about her\\nplaying hide-and-seek with a little girl.\\nWhat?\\nI had a dream.\\nShe was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.\\nCassie and I do it all the time.\\nDoesn\\'t mean anything.\\nBut was it Cassie in the dream?\\nNo.\\nWhere was she hiding?\\n- What? - The little girl.\\nWhere was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?\\nNo, it was in a tall dresser.\\nYou mean a wardrobe.\\nIs that what that\\'s called?\\nWhat color was it?\\nRed.\\nWere there horses on it?\\nOh, boy.\\nIt\\'s where I hid every time that we played.\\nIt doesn\\'t sound like\\nyou really got the gist of the game.\\nShe\\'s alive.\\nI knew it.\\nI knew it!\\nWe need to get that part.\\nOkay.\\nThe sooner we get the tunnel working...\\nthe sooner we can get this message out of his head.\\nDoes Burch have it?\\n- Yeah. Let\\'s go. - What part?\\nWho\\'s Burch? Wait. What\\'s happening?\\nWe need a component to stop the tunnel\\nfrom overloading again.\\nI grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.\\nLook, I\\'d really like to help you...\\nbut if I\\'m not at home when they come\\nto take off my ankle monitor...\\nthen I\\'m going away forever.\\nOnce we get the component and power up the tunnel...\\nwe\\'ll get the message, and have you home by lunch.\\nWe have to hurry. The entanglement won\\'t last.\\nYou owe us.\\nAll right, fine. But can I just wait inside?\\nBecause I\\'m not supposed to be out here.\\nLet\\'s go.\\n- We good? - Yeah.\\nI\\'ll be right back.\\n- Can I have one of these? - No.\\nAh. Susan! Welcome to Oui!\\nSonny!\\nOui is French for \"yes.\"\\nAs in \"yes\" to farm-to-table, \"yes\" to locally sourced...\\nand \"yes\" to planet before profit.\\nWell, let\\'s hope it also means \"yes\"\\nto \"Do you have the component I ordered?\"\\nYou know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan.\\nHave a seat.\\nNo, I\\'m good. Thank you.\\nWho is this guy?\\nSonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology.\\nHe\\'s been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.\\nCould I just have one...\\nNo.\\nYou know, I have a special friend at the FBI.\\nAnd I say \"special\"...\\nbecause, well, he tells me things\\nthat I didn\\'t previously know.\\nFor example...\\nyour name isn\\'t Susan.\\nIt\\'s Hope Van Dyne.\\nAnd your unseen associate, that\\'s your father, Hank Pym.\\n- That\\'s not good, Hank. - No shit.\\nWhat do you want?\\nRelationships are built on trust, Hope.\\nAnd I want our relationship to have a strong foundation.\\nOur relationship?\\nMy business landscape has been shifting, Hope.\\nHell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don\\'t even exist anymore...\\nbut now, Hank Pym...\\nHank Pym is a real opportunity.\\nDo you have a point?\\nOh, you think that I don\\'t know\\nwhat you\\'ve been building with all this?\\nQuantum technology.\\nNow, you can forget nanotech, forget AI,\\nforget cryptocurrency.\\nQuantum energy is the future.\\nIt\\'s the next gold rush.\\nIs that so?\\nI want in, Hope.\\nSo, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty...\\nof arranging some buyers for your lab.\\nStarting bid...\\none billion dollars.\\nThank you, Sonny, really.\\nBut my father and I have something\\nslightly more pressing than starting a business.\\nSo I\\'ll just take the component as arranged.\\nMy buyers don\\'t take no for an answer.\\nSo, we are either in business together...\\nor we aren\\'t in business together.\\nThen I guess we aren\\'t.\\nYou can go.\\nBut I\\'m afraid your money\\'s gonna have to remain.\\nLet\\'s call it compensation for my injured feelings.\\nListen, Sonny.\\nThis is gonna be so much easier on everybody\\nif you just give me that component.\\nDarlin\\', the only thing you\\'re takin\\' from here...\\nis my heart, but it will mend in time.\\nOkay.\\nSo, now what?\\nYou\\'ll see.\\nShe said her and her daddy had something pressing.\\n- Mmm-hmm. - I want to know what it is\\nbecause if they\\'re not working with us...\\nthey\\'re working with somebody. So find out.\\nI want some names...\\nHold on, you gave her wings?\\nGet her.\\nNot my turn-of-the-century chandelier!\\nStop firing! Stop!\\nAll right, take this. Go. Go, go, go!\\nGo!\\nWings and blasters.\\nSo I take it you didn\\'t have that tech available for me.\\nNo, I did.\\nIt was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny.\\nOh, our business isn\\'t finished yet, Hope.\\nI can assure you of that!\\nWhat in the hell is that?\\nDad, are you seeing this?\\nHope, get out of there!\\n- I gotta do something. - Wait!\\nIt is still a work in progress.\\nYou taught me that kick. Remember?\\nYeah, great form.\\nThose were the days. Whatever happened to us?\\nNot the time, Scott.\\nDamn it, where\\'d it go?\\nI\\'ve lost it.\\nI\\'m not seeing anything on the ant cams.\\nTry looking...\\nDad?\\nGive me that.\\nNow.\\n- Are you okay? - No!\\nHe got the lab.\\nNo.\\nCome on!\\nWhat was that?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nBut we need to find somewhere to regroup\\nand figure out where the lab is.\\nSo, where to now?\\nHow about my house? Hmm?\\nI\\'m supposed to be there anyway,\\nand Woo could walk in any second.\\nExactly why we\\'re not going to your house.\\nWhat about your house?\\nSorry.\\nWell, there is one place I can think of.\\nNo.\\nNo, no, no, no!\\nNo!\\nWow, Dr. Pym...\\nwho would\\'ve thought that,\\nonce again, in your hour of need...\\nthat you would turn to us, you know?\\nNot me.\\nMmm. Help yourself.\\nHey, what\\'s up with the fancy pastry?\\nWe gotta keep the food budget down.\\nWell, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?\\nThe oatmeal packets.\\nOatmeal packets.\\n- It\\'s insult. - Why is it an insult?\\nBecause it tastes like sand.\\nYou know why? \\'Cause it\\'s organic.\\nIt\\'s not organic, it\\'s sand.\\nIt\\'s the most important meal of the day.\\nYou know what, you can get creative with it.\\nBreak teeth.\\nPut a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon.\\nPut a little honey. Whatever you want...\\nGuys, guys, guys. Come on, man.\\nWe got bigger fish to fry.\\nIs that my desk?\\n- Yeah. - What?\\nWhy do I have such a small desk?\\nBecause you weren\\'t there when we were choosing desks.\\nYou snooze, you lose.\\nWell, I was under house arrest.\\nYeah.\\nYou know what, this isn\\'t even a desk.\\nThis is garbage.\\nYou found this outside amongst garbage.\\nI got it at a rummage sale.\\nSo, you save money on my desk?\\nGuys.\\nHope, please, we need to focus, all right?\\nWe gotta find that lab already. Jeez.\\nOh, you know what? I heard stories,\\nlike what happened to you.\\nThis crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff.\\nLike a ghost.\\nLike Baba Yaga.\\nBaba Yaga, the witch.\\nThey tell stories to children to frighten them.\\nYou know Baba Yaga?\\nWhoever stole it...\\nwe need to find it.\\nOh, you don\\'t find someone like that. They find you.\\nLike Baba Yaga.\\nDr. Pym, you\\'re the smartest genius I know.\\nDidn\\'t you put some kind of LoJack on your lab?\\nBecause if you didn\\'t,\\nwe have a variety of affordable options.\\nOf course I did, Luis. It was disabled.\\nWhoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing.\\nThey also looked like they were phasing.\\nPhasing?\\nQuantum phasing. When an object moves\\nthrough different states of matter.\\nOh, yeah, that\\'s what I was thinking.\\nThe lab emits radiation.\\nCan we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?\\nThat could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab.\\nWhere else can we find that equipment?\\nWell, there is one person.\\nBill Foster.\\nGreat!\\nWho\\'s Bill Foster?\\nHe\\'s an old colleague of my dad\\'s, from S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nThey had a falling out years ago.\\nYou seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.\\nIt\\'s probably just a waste of time.\\nHey, I\\'m risking everything by being here.\\nDon\\'t you think we should check?\\nWe need to find out who took the lab.\\nGuys, it\\'s not a good idea\\nto be out in the open like this.\\nRelax, no one\\'s gonna recognize us.\\nWhat, because of hats and sunglasses?\\nThat\\'s not a disguise, Hank.\\nWe look like ourselves at a baseball game.\\nIn an isolated system...\\nparticles co-exist in a stable phase relationship.\\nIf the system is interfered with,\\nthat stability becomes chaos.\\nUnpredictable.\\nDangerous. Beautiful.\\nIsolated completely, a quantum system\\nwould revert back to separate states of matter...\\neach entangled with a distinct state of its environment.\\nIn other words, the object in question\\nwould be both in and out of phase...\\nwith multiple parallel realities.\\nSpeaking of being out of phase with reality.\\nI am noticing an unusually high number\\nof glazed eyes out there among you.\\nSo, why don\\'t we call it a few minutes early?\\nThat\\'ll be enough for today.\\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go.\\nIt\\'s incredible. You\\'re linked to Janet.\\nIt\\'s quantum entanglement between the quantum states of\\nPosner molecules in your brains.\\nYeah, that\\'s what I was thinking.\\nDo you guys just put the word \"quantum\"\\nin front of everything?\\nDoctor, we need to find our lab.\\nHope, I\\'d love to help you...\\nbut I don\\'t have anything\\nlike the equipment you\\'re describing.\\nI told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let\\'s go.\\nDon\\'t condescend, Hank.\\nYou\\'re the one who\\'s on the run from the FBI.\\nAll because you had to grow to a size\\nthat finally fit your ego.\\nThat wasn\\'t me in Germany. It was this idiot.\\nReally?\\nGoing that big, it must\\'ve been exhausting.\\nI slept for three days straight. You have no idea.\\nActually, I do.\\nBack in the day, I was Hank\\'s partner\\non a project called Goliath.\\nExcuse me? You were my partner?\\nThe only thing more tiring than going that big\\nis putting up with Hank\\'s bullshit.\\nRight...\\nI don\\'t know. How big did you get?\\nMy record? 21 feet.\\n- Not bad. - You?\\nI don\\'t...\\nNo, really, I\\'m curious.\\n- 65 feet. Yeah. - Whoa!\\n- Huge. - 65.\\nIf you two are finished comparing sizes...\\nwe need to figure out a way to track down the lab.\\nAnd the great Hank Pym hasn\\'t figured that one out yet?\\nStrange.\\nYou had all the answers back in the day.\\nThat\\'s why I left the project.\\nLeft? I fired you.\\nBest decision I ever made.\\nHank was a terrible partner. Temperamental...\\nstubborn, impatient.\\nSooner or later, he just pushed everyone away.\\nJust the mediocrities.\\nJanet was the only one who could endure him\\nand chose to stick it out.\\nWatch it, Bill.\\nShe paid the price, though, didn\\'t she?\\nYou son of a bitch.\\nI didn\\'t come here to listen to you two squabble.\\nI\\'m trying to save my mother.\\nNow, which office would you say?\\nOh, it\\'s Woo.\\nSomeone must have seen me.\\nRelax. If this is about you,\\nthey\\'d be in your house by now.\\nWhat are you, 15?\\nCome on. We gotta go right now.\\nWait. You might be able to improvise that tracker...\\nif you modify the diffraction units\\non one of your regulators.\\n- That could work. - I don\\'t know what that means.\\nThank you. Thank you.\\nBut, Doctor, campus police says\\nthey ID\\'d both Pym and Van Dyne.\\nI don\\'t know what to tell you, Agent.\\nI haven\\'t talked to Hank in 30 years.\\nI can assure you I\\'m the last person\\nhe would want to visit.\\nOh, come on, you expect us to...\\nHey, hey.\\nWhy is that?\\nSimple. We hate each other\\'s guts.\\nSo I\\'m a terrible partner?\\nFoster, he hasn\\'t had one good idea\\nin his unremarkable career.\\nBut his idea about the diffractors could work, right?\\nFine, one decent idea.\\nExcept, I eliminated the diffractors\\nwhen I upgraded the suits.\\nSo, if we had an old suit,\\nwe might be able to track down the lab?\\nYes, but we don\\'t.\\n- What if we did? - What do you mean?\\nI mean...\\nlife\\'s funny.\\nOh, my God. You didn\\'t destroy the suit.\\nWhat?\\nWell, it was your life\\'s work, Hank.\\nI couldn\\'t destroy that.\\nBefore I turned myself in,\\nI shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.\\nYou sent my suit through the mail?\\nHey, the postal service is very reliable.\\nYou know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS.\\nWhere is it?\\nIt\\'s in a very safe place, all right? Don\\'t worry.\\nWhat, the trophy? No, it\\'s not here.\\nWhat do you mean it\\'s not there? Where could it be?\\nI looked everywhere. It\\'s not here.\\nHey, get away from the plant.\\nBut I put it back after Cassie and I...\\nShow-and-tell.\\nScotty?\\nNo, stop!\\nWell, the good news is I know where it is.\\nWhenever you go back to school...\\nisn\\'t everything supposed to look so much smaller?\\nThis place seems huge.\\nWhat is it?\\nIt\\'s the new regulator.\\nHank, what\\'s going on with this suit?\\nHow much of a work in progress is this?\\nUh-oh. No, no, no.\\nOh.\\nWhat are you, laughing? Please, could you just...\\nOkay, okay.\\nWhat do you see?\\nThe sizing coils are malfunctioning.\\nJust let me...\\nOw!\\n- Sorry. - It\\'s all right.\\nOkay. All right.\\nTry that.\\nSorry.\\nWhat?\\nAwesome.\\nIf only Cap could see you now.\\nHilarious. What are we gonna do?\\nHey!\\nWhere\\'s your hall pass?\\nHey, I\\'m talking to you.\\nHey!\\nHey. Eh...\\nYou can do it.\\nYou almost got it.\\nOh, peanut.\\nOkay, let\\'s go.\\nHiya, champ, how was school today?\\nAll right, get your jokes out now. Can you fix the suit?\\nSo cranky.\\nYou want a juice box and some string cheese?\\nDo you really have that?\\nLet\\'s see if Foster was right.\\nThis has gotta be the lab.\\nLet\\'s go get it.\\nYeah.\\nThis seems right.\\nLook at us, teaming up twice in one day.\\nMakes you think, huh?\\nAbout what?\\nGermany.\\nWhat do you mean?\\nWe were working together, training together...\\nand other stuffing together.\\nIf I had asked you, would you have come?\\nI guess we\\'ll never know.\\nBut I do know one thing.\\nWhat?\\nIf I had, you\\'d have never been caught.\\nHey, Scott.\\nYou think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter\\nlong enough to get my lab?\\n- Yes, sir. - Thank you.\\nOkay, you\\'re transmitting.\\nWhat took you so long?\\nSorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant.\\nI\\'m thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.\\nYou like it?\\nHilarious.\\nI\\'m not getting anything on the monitors.\\nThere\\'s some kind of electronic disturbance.\\nBe careful.\\nYou know me, Hank. I\\'m always careful... Whoa!\\nIt\\'s okay. It\\'s just the suit.\\n- How do you know? - Look.\\nThat\\'s Ghost?\\nWhat is she doing?\\nDo you think that suit is how\\nshe goes through walls and stuff?\\nLet\\'s just get outta here before she wakes up.\\nHope, look! There\\'s the lab.\\nNow, we\\'re sure this is our shrunken building\\nand not somebody else\\'s, right?\\nJust take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast.\\nI\\'ll get it.\\nOh, shit...\\nHope. Hope! Hank.\\nGuys.\\nI don\\'t think they can hear you.\\nHi.\\nI\\'m Ava.\\nScott.\\nSo, you don\\'t need the suit...\\nto go through things.\\nNo.\\nIt just helps me control it.\\nAnd the pain, supposedly.\\nYou\\'re not gonna reach into my chest\\nand crush my heart, are you?\\nYou\\'re funny.\\nI\\'m not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to.\\nI need...\\nwhat\\'s in your head.\\nLet\\'s wake up the rest of the gang\\nand get this over with, shall we?\\nGet up!\\nCome on!\\nDad?\\nDon\\'t ever touch him again.\\nNow, now, Hope...\\nI think I\\'m being rather gentle with your father,\\nall things considered.\\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\\nAnother casualty of Hank Pym\\'s ego.\\nBill.\\nWhat have you done?\\nIt\\'s what you\\'ve done, Dr. Pym.\\nYou\\'re with her?\\nOh, man. I thought you were cool.\\nWhat the hell is going on here?\\nI doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.\\nWhy would he?\\nElihas Starr.\\nThey were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nQuantum research.\\nUntil my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym.\\nYou had him fired.\\nOh, and discredited for good measure.\\nMy father tried to continue his research on his own.\\nDesperate to restore his name, so he took risks.\\nNo, no, no!\\nToo many.\\nUntil something went wrong.\\nHe told us to run.\\nElihas, what\\'s happening?\\nJust go. Go!\\nDaddy! Daddy!\\nI could tell he was scared.\\nDaddy!\\nAva, no!\\nI didn\\'t want him to be alone.\\nNo! No!\\nWhen I woke up, my parents were dead.\\nI wasn\\'t so lucky.\\nThey call it \"molecular disequilibrium.\"\\nA rather dull name, I think.\\nDoesn\\'t quite do justice to what it means.\\nEvery cell in my body is torn apart...\\nand stitched back together.\\nOver and over.\\nEvery day.\\nI was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call\\nabout a quantum anomaly in Argentina.\\nHello, Ava.\\nMy name\\'s Bill.\\nI was a friend of your father\\'s.\\nI brought you something.\\nIt\\'s all right. Try again.\\nThat\\'s it.\\nDr. Foster did his best to keep me safe.\\nBut others at S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nsaw an opportunity in my affliction.\\nThey built me a containment suit,\\nso I could control my phasing.\\nAnd trained me to be a stealth operative.\\nThey weaponized me.\\nI stole for them. Spied for them.\\nKilled for them.\\nAnd in exchange for my soul...\\nthey were going to cure me.\\nThey lied.\\nWhen S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in.\\nI built the chamber to slow her decay,\\nbut her condition was progressive.\\nI didn\\'t know how to cure it.\\nShe wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no...\\nand that she should watch you instead.\\nAnd sure enough, she discovered\\nthat you were building the tunnel.\\nThen, she told me about Lang.\\nAnd the message from Janet inside his head,\\nthat\\'s when I...\\nChrist\\'s sake!\\nThat\\'s me. I\\'m sorry.\\nLook, can you tell me who\\'s texting me?\\n\"Cassie, 911.\"\\nThat\\'s my daughter. I need to text her back.\\nNo, that\\'s not happening.\\nWhat, it\\'s 911. That means it\\'s an emergency.\\nYou\\'re not making demands here, Lang.\\nYou\\'re not appreciating the gravity of the...\\nOkay, look, she\\'s trying to video chat me now.\\nSomething might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please.\\nCassie, are you okay? What\\'s the emergency?\\nI can\\'t find my soccer shoes.\\nWhat?\\nI have a game tomorrow.\\nHey, Scott, I know that they\\'re there.\\nCan you just walk the phone around the house?\\nNo, I can\\'t do that right now.\\n- Why not? - Because I\\'m sick.\\nHey, can you just maybe look around\\nlater then and call me back?\\nPlease? Thank you.\\nBye, Daddy!\\n- Bye, peanut! - Feel better!\\nFeel better, buddy!\\nI\\'m sorry. It said emergency.\\nAva, I want to help you.\\nShe doesn\\'t need your help. I know how to save her.\\nOh, really? How?\\nJanet.\\nFor the last 30 years, she\\'s been down there\\nabsorbing quantum energy.\\nWe can extract that energy.\\nWe can use it to repair Ava\\'s molecular structure...\\nExtract it?\\n- Yes. - Are you insane?\\nThat would rip Janet apart.\\nYou don\\'t know that. I\\'m gonna fire up your tunnel.\\nWhen Janet\\'s location\\npops into Lang\\'s head, he\\'s gonna give it to me...\\nor I\\'m gonna turn him over to the FBI.\\nWhat?\\nYou are gonna stay here...\\njust in case I need your help.\\nLike hell I would help you!\\nYou\\'ll do whatever I say.\\nYou\\'re gonna kill Janet!\\nI\\'d be more worried about yourself, Hank.\\nGoddamn it, Bill!\\n- Dad? - Calm down, Hank.\\nSo help me God...\\nThe pills.\\nIt\\'s his heart! He needs his pills.\\nPlease, Dr. Foster. They\\'re in the tin. Please.\\nHe could die!\\nCome on!\\nHelp him!\\nDad, just hang on, all right?\\nJust keep breathing. Stay calm.\\nHelp him, man! Come on!\\nThe Altoid tin!\\nWait!\\nThanks, guys.\\nHank!\\nBill is filling that girl\\'s head with lies.\\nElihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans.\\nNow, bring it down. All right, lock it in.\\nNo, no, no. The bolt is on the other side.\\nTighten that one down, then bring it down one notch.\\nGood job.\\nIt\\'ll work.\\nFoster, he could have fried the entire system.\\nLook, we\\'ll adjust the relays\\nwhile you go reprogram the settings, all right?\\nIt\\'s going to be fine.\\nSo, this is it.\\nYeah. You\\'d think with all this time\\nto prepare I\\'d be more ready.\\nOh, going subatomic isn\\'t something you can prepare for.\\nIt kind of melts your mind.\\nI mean seeing my mom again.\\nOh.\\nWhat if she\\'s a completely different person?\\nYeah, like, uh, George Washington.\\nI\\'m serious, Scott.\\nOr George Jefferson.\\nWhat if she\\'s forgotten about me?\\nWhen I was in prison...\\nthe only thing that got me through was Cassie.\\nI could have been locked up for 100 years...\\nI never would have forgotten her.\\nI know your mom is counting the minutes\\nuntil she can see you again.\\nThank you.\\nHey.\\nWe got a big problem.\\nYou forgot the motion sensor lights\\non the back of the building.\\nOh, no.\\nAnd they\\'re on the proposal,\\nand Karapetyan asked for them specifically.\\nUh, yeah, look, it\\'s been a little crazy.\\nLook, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it.\\nNo. No, no, no, no.\\nThe meeting is first thing in the morning.\\nYou gotta come right now and fix it.\\nI can\\'t. I wish I could, but I can\\'t leave.\\nYou know what, I\\'m coming to you.\\nI\\'ll just bring the plans. They\\'re on the laptop.\\nAnd you can fix them there.\\nJust tell me where you are, okay?\\nIt\\'s complicated.\\nWhat do you mean it\\'s complicated?\\nAs you can see, sir,\\nthis system is state of the art.\\nSecurity of tomorrow, today.\\nOh, that\\'s so good!\\nAnd I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin\\'.\\nHey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty\\'s,\\nso we can fix the plans.\\nBut don\\'t worry, I\\'ll be back in plenty of time.\\n- As you can see... - Oh, oh, oh!\\nTell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning.\\nDown to the undercarriage, baby.\\nYou sprung for the undercarriage wash?\\nWell, you said get the works.\\nThat\\'s a scam, bro. We live in California, not Minnesota.\\nHe\\'s right.\\nThe undercarriage wash,\\nthat\\'s for cleaning off road salt...\\nlaid down in our more snow-laden sister states.\\nWho are you, and why do you know so much\\nabout car wash protocol?\\nWell, my name is Sonny Burch.\\nAnd I do my research, Luis.\\nTo wit, I have learned from a friend of mine...\\nat the FBI that you are\\na known associate of Scott Lang...\\na known associate of Hank Pym, who I\\'ve also learned...\\nhas a portable shrinking laboratory...\\nfilled with all kinds of juicy tech.\\nAnd you\\'re gonna tell me where it is.\\nWell, I hate to break it to you,\\nbut I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\nWell, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.\\nAnd I have promised results to some dangerous people.\\nSo, I\\'m gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman.\\nNow...\\nUzman is a master\\nat extracting information from the unwilling...\\nthrough psychoactive means.\\nOh, is that truth serum?\\nThere\\'s no such thing as truth serum.\\nThat\\'s just nonsense from TV.\\nWell, what is it then?\\nIt\\'s a little concoction\\nthat he\\'s been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S.\\nIt makes you suggestible and highly responsive.\\nWell, dude, that\\'s truth serum.\\nNo, it\\'s not.\\nNo offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me.\\n- Right? - It\\'s not a truth serum.\\nOkay. Hey, I believe you.\\nIt\\'s not a truth serum.\\nI mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks...\\nThe truth serum.\\nWell, I have a lot of allergies...\\nso you might wanna think about that.\\nWe\\'ve got to get that lab back.\\nWhat?\\nThe chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.\\nHow long have I got?\\nA couple of weeks, maybe.\\nWell, then we\\'ll make them bring the lab back.\\nHow?\\nLang. He has a daughter, right?\\nYou can\\'t mean that.\\nAva!\\nI tolerate a lot of the things you do out there...\\nbut I won\\'t be a part of anything like that.\\nYou\\'re not the one who\\'s about\\nto fade away into nothing, Bill.\\nI am!\\nYou said you could fix me!\\nYou promised.\\nI know. I will.\\nBut not like that.\\nYou lay one finger on that little girl...\\nI won\\'t help you. And we\\'re done.\\nFine.\\nThere are other options.\\nYou know what? You\\'re right. This isn\\'t truth serum.\\nBecause I don\\'t feel anything.\\nThat was a lie. I do feel something.\\nThis is truth serum!\\nThere\\'s no such thing!\\nOkay.\\nOkay, okay.\\nNow, I\\'m gonna make this real easy for you, Luis.\\nOkay.\\nWhere is Scott Lang?\\nWell, see, that\\'s complicated.\\nBecause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.\\nAnd I\\'m not talkin\\' about cell block D.\\nHis wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like...\\n\"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you\\'re on lockup?\"\\nAnd he was, like, \"Yeah, I know.\\n\"I thought I was gonna be with her forever...\\n\"but now I\\'m all alone.\"\\nAnd I was, like, \"Damn, homie. You know what?\\n\"You gotta chin up, because you\\'ll find a new partner.\\n\"But you know what? I\\'m Luis.\"\\nAnd he says, \"You know what? I\\'m Scotty,\\n\"and we\\'re gonna be best friends.\"\\nOkay, hold on, hold on.\\nI like a good story as much as the next person...\\nbut what in the hell does this have to do\\nwith where Scott Lang is?\\nI\\'m getting there. I\\'m getting there.\\nYou put a dime in him,\\nyou gotta let the whole song play out.\\nHe like human jukebox.\\nOh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant!\\nYeah, only played Morrissey.\\nAnd if anybody ever complained, she\\'d be like...\\nYou know, Chicanos, we call him \"Moz.\"\\nThen, Â¡adios!\\nWhat can I say? We relate to his\\nmelancholy ballads, you know?\\n- Lang! - Right, right, right.\\nSo, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,\\nand he starts working for Hank.\\nThat\\'s when he met Hope. And Hope\\'s all, like...\\n\"I want nothing to do with you.\\n\"Look at my hairdo, I\\'m all business.\"\\nAnd then Scotty\\'s, like,\\n\"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken.\\n\"And I\\'ll probably never find love again,\\n\"but damn if I want to kiss you!\"\\nBut then you fast forward\\nand they\\'re all into each other, right?\\nAnd then Scotty\\'s, like,\\n\"You know what? I can\\'t tell you this...\\n\"but I\\'m gonna go trash an airport with Captain America.\"\\nAnd then she said, \"I can\\'t believe you split like that!\\n\"Smell you later, dummy.\"\\nSo, Scotty goes on house arrest.\\nAnd he won\\'t admit it, but his heart is all, like...\\n\"Damn! I thought Hope coulda been\\n\"my new true partner, but I blew it!\"\\nBut fate brought \\'em back together.\\nAnd then Hope\\'s heart is all...\\n\"I\\'m worried that I can\\'t trust him...\\n\"and he\\'s gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!\"\\nAnd then my heart is all, like...\\n\"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company\\'s red\\n\"and we\\'re days away from going out of business. Oh!\"\\n\"Out of business\"?\\n\"Days away\"?\\nDamn truth serum!\\nI was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God.\\nI was trying to be a good boss, but we\\'re broke!\\nAnd the Karapetyan\\'s our last hope.\\nAnd if we don\\'t show up, we\\'re done!\\nThat\\'s terrible bossing!\\nDamn, bro!\\n- That\\'s on me! That\\'s on me! - Hey!\\nEnough.\\nI\\'m gonna ask you one more time.\\nWhere is Scott Lang?\\nI\\'ve been trying to tell you,\\nhe\\'s in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.\\nEmotionally speaking.\\nWell, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking!\\nOh! The woods.\\nThe woods?\\nBaba Yaga!\\nWhat do you mean, \"the woods\"?\\nThe Muir Woods, the second fire road\\noff the Panoramic Highway!\\nFor God\\'s sake!\\nâª Baba Yaga, come at night\\nâª Little children, sleepy tight âª\\nDamn it!\\nIf that freak gets Pym\\'s tech...\\nI\\'m never gonna see it.\\nSo, what do we do now?\\nIt\\'s easier to steal it from the Feds\\nthan from the boogeyman.\\nHey, it\\'s me. How\\'d you like to get a promotion?\\nI got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.\\nBut you gonna have to take \\'em down now,\\nbecause they ain\\'t gonna be there for long.\\nAnd when you do, you gonna get me that lab.\\nUnderstood.\\nGood news, gentlemen.\\nFeds are gonna do the hard work for us.\\nWhat are you lookin\\' at? Change my tires!\\nRight.\\n- Sir. - Can you knock?\\nSorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead.\\nOoh, I love leads.\\nSystem\\'s in the green.\\nPriming the coils.\\nFull charge.\\nAs soon as the tunnel\\'s open...\\nlet us know if you get anything\\nthat could be a part of her message.\\nYeah, yeah. I will.\\nOkay, then.\\nHere it goes.\\nWe did it!\\nYou got anything?\\nNothin\\'.\\nWell, just give it a minute, because it could...\\nNo.\\nNo, no, no, no!\\nWhat\\'s happening?\\nIt\\'s shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.\\nWe\\'ve gone over them a million times, I know they\\'re right!\\nThen what else could it be?\\nI don\\'t know!\\n- Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that!\\nScott, you can\\'t...\\nI\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know how much time I have.\\nI need to fix the algorithm.\\nTrust me, after 30 years down here...\\nI\\'ve thought about it a lot.\\nJanet?\\nHi, honey.\\nJellybean.\\nMom?\\nIt\\'s not the reunion I\\'d imagined.\\nIt\\'s all so rushed.\\nYou two have done such great work.\\nYou just need a little...\\nnudge.\\nJanet, how is this possible?\\nIt wasn\\'t a message you put\\nin Scott\\'s head. It was an antenna.\\nClever girl.\\nI\\'m so proud of you.\\nHoney, tell us where you are.\\nTell us how to find you.\\nNo, the probability fields are too complex.\\nThat\\'s why I needed to talk to you.\\nYou have to follow my voice.\\nOf course!\\nLike tracing a call back to its source!\\nI\\'m tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies...\\nbetween point two and point nine.\\nI\\'d narrow it to four and six.\\nThat\\'s too tight. We could miss you.\\nLook at us squabbling again.\\nFine. All right, between three and seven.\\nOur first fight in decades, and it\\'s over just like that.\\nBullseye.\\nSource lock.\\nIt\\'s you.\\nWe got it!\\nYou have to meet me at these exact coordinates.\\nIn the wasteland, beyond the quantum void.\\nIt\\'s very dangerous,\\nespecially on the human mind, so be careful.\\nTime and space work very differently down here.\\nYou have two hours.\\nAfter that, the probability fields will shift...\\nand it\\'ll be another century\\nbefore they align like this again.\\nWe\\'ll find you.\\nI know you will, Jellybean.\\nNope.\\nNothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet.\\nPerfect.\\nHow did we get up here?\\nAll right, first you\\'re gonna see all kinds of lights...\\nand it\\'s gonna get really trippy...\\nbut then it\\'s gonna turn black and silent. Really silent.\\nScott, I\\'ll be fine.\\nI\\'m just saying because I\\'ve been down there.\\nYeah, so you\\'ve mentioned.\\nUm, sorry. I have to take this.\\nHey, man, you coming?\\nNo, I\\'m not, but you know what? Ghost is.\\nAnd you know what? The Feds, they know where you are.\\n- What? - I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.\\nUh, they gave me some truth serum.\\nAnd then all of a sudden\\nI started talkin\\' all honestly.\\nLike, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher.\\nI hate it, I hate it.\\n- Uh... - But you need to go home...\\nbecause the Feds are probably going there now!\\nAnd by the way...\\nwho puts the plates on the top rack? They don\\'t go there!\\nI feel like such a jerk.\\nYou\\'re gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.\\nWhat?\\nGhost knows where we are. So does the FBI.\\nHow?\\n- I told Luis where we are. - You what?\\nI told him to come here so I could help him\\nwith the Karapetyan proposal.\\nOh, my God!\\nLook, we need to land that account.\\nOtherwise, we lose the business!\\nDo you know hard it is for ex-cons\\nto find work these days?\\nJesus, Scott!\\n90 seconds to close the aperture!\\nYou have to depolarize the coils first!\\nI know!\\nI\\'m really sorry...\\nbut the, um, FBI is coming to my place so...\\nI have to go.\\nCan I borrow the suit?\\nGyroscopic stabilizers.\\nPowering on.\\nI\\'m just gonna borrow the suit.\\nI\\'ll come back. Just tell me where you\\'ll be.\\n- Don\\'t bother. - What?\\nWe\\'ll come and get the suit from you,\\nas soon as we\\'ve found my mom.\\n- Hope... - Scott, just go!\\n- Scott? - Daddy?\\nIt\\'s us, buddy!\\nWe\\'re here for Cassie\\'s shoes!\\nHe must be resting.\\nHoney, why don\\'t you go upstairs\\nand look under your bed?\\nDaddy, you upstairs?\\nDaddy?\\nWhat the...\\nHe really lives like a pig these days.\\nDaddy?\\nSpread out!\\nAgain?\\nYou people have no shame!\\nThe monitor says that he\\'s in the bathroom.\\nYeah, I\\'m not buying it!\\nCassie, let the man get by!\\nBut Daddy\\'s super sick!\\nI\\'ll see about that!\\nHe says he doesn\\'t want anyone else to get sick!\\nI\\'ll take my chances, sweetie.\\nHe barfed. Like, a lot.\\nYoung lady, I\\'m a federal agent.\\nI\\'ve seen worse things than vomit.\\nLike, \"a lot\" a lot?\\n- Yes! - Forget it, move aside!\\nNo!\\nWoo!\\n- What are you doing here? - Scott.\\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m just really sick.\\nI told you.\\nExcuse me.\\nSometimes you gotta just get it out. You know?\\nSorry.\\nI\\'ll start the van.\\nYou get the lab.\\nFreeze! You\\'re surrounded!\\nHank Pym...\\nHope Van Dyne...\\nyou\\'re under arrest.\\nThis is harassment!\\nActually, it\\'s not.\\nWhat does the FBI even stand for...\\n\"Forever Bothering Individuals\"?\\n- His monitor check out? - Of course it does.\\nDamn it!\\nLooks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.\\nWe got \\'em sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.\\nSeriously? Yes!\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, Scott.\\nThey\\'re your friends. That\\'s insensitive.\\nI just really needed a win, you know?\\nAnyway, I\\'ll be back later\\nfor the official end of your sentence!\\nSorry for misjudging you, pal!\\nYou should feel great about yourself!\\nWhat is it?\\nWe have a man down.\\nAnd Pym\\'s lab is gone.\\nHey.\\nThanks for covering for me.\\nSure.\\nSo...\\nhow long have you been Ant-Man again?\\nNot long.\\nIt just sort of happened.\\nI\\'m sorry for lying to you...\\nand I\\'m sorry for risking everything.\\nDaddy, it\\'s okay.\\nIt\\'s not.\\nI do some dumb things...\\nand the people that I love the most pay the price.\\nMainly you.\\nTrying to help people isn\\'t dumb.\\nI screw it up just about every time.\\nSo, maybe you just need someone watching your back...\\nlike a partner.\\nWell, she\\'s made it clear\\nthat\\'s about the last thing she wants.\\nWho?\\nHope.\\nWait, who did you think?\\nMe.\\nYou?\\nDon\\'t laugh.\\nI\\'d be a great partner.\\nAw, peanut.\\nAw. You would be awesome. And if I let you...\\nI would be a terrible dad.\\nFine.\\nThen have Hope be your partner. She\\'s smart.\\nShe reminds me of you.\\nYou gonna go help her?\\nI think you should help her.\\nI wish I could...\\nbut I don\\'t know how I could help her without hurting you.\\nYou can do it.\\nYou can do anything.\\nYou are the world\\'s greatest grandma.\\nAgent Woo will see you in an hour.\\nAn hour? We don\\'t have an hour.\\nOh, you got somewhere else to be?\\nOh, now, that\\'s my girl.\\nAll right, what\\'s our plan?\\nTo shrink that wall.\\nIt looks load-bearing.\\nThe ceiling could collapse.\\nThen we run like hell.\\nNow, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor.\\nRoughly five times that in the building at large.\\nThey\\'re all heavily armed.\\nNot great odds.\\nYou got any better ideas?\\nNope.\\nAnd I\\'m not giving up on Mom.\\nShe\\'d be so proud of you.\\nOkay.\\nOne...\\ntwo...\\nScott?\\nWhat\\'re you two just standing around for?\\nWe gotta go find that lab.\\nWhat about me?\\nPerfect.\\nHurry up and get dressed. We don\\'t have much time.\\nOkay, now what?\\nYou\\'re asking me?\\nGet in!\\nHi.\\nHi.\\nUh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon...\\nor are you two gonna keep staring at each other...\\nuntil they start shooting at us?\\nYeah.\\n- Hey, Burch. - Yeah.\\nYeah, they\\'re out.\\nI\\'m on my way.\\nHer suit is missing, and so is the van.\\nHow could this happen?\\nI mean, what the dickens?\\nThank you.\\nYou\\'re welcome.\\nSo, uh, how do we find the lab?\\nAfter we lost it the first time...\\nI put on a new tracker...\\nof sorts.\\nThat\\'ll work.\\nIs it ready or not?\\nWe can begin the extraction process.\\nListen, Ava.\\nThis whole thing could be very dangerous.\\nMaybe we should...\\nMaybe we should what? Wait?\\nI\\'ve got days until I\\'m dead.\\nWe\\'re doing this, Bill. Now.\\nEnergy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.\\nWe don\\'t have much time before\\nMom\\'s location shifts, and we lose her.\\nYeah, and we have a lot to do before then.\\nYou know, my pep-pep always said,\\n\"If you want to do something right, you make a list.\"\\nSo, we should do that.\\nOne, we have to break into that lab.\\nTwo, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost.\\nThree, we\\'re gonna have to fight Ghost.\\nThat seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right?\\nLet\\'s call it 2-A.\\nFight Ghost. 2-A.\\nOh, also, we have to make sure that the lab\\nis fully grown for you to come back.\\nOtherwise, we\\'re screwed.\\nScott!\\nYou want me to start again? I\\'ll start again...\\nI\\'m going to dive.\\nThe only chance we got is if the two of you are out here...\\ntogether, protecting the tunnel.\\nLet me do this, Hope. Please.\\nLet me get her.\\nI think he\\'s right.\\n\"Whassup?\"\\nYou don\\'t remember, uh, that beloved commercial?\\n\"Whassup?\"\\nI had him follow us.\\nI thought we could use some help.\\nAll right. I\\'m in position.\\nThe ants are headed in.\\nCopy that.\\nKeep your eyes peeled, Scotty.\\n- Do you want Pez? - No.\\nCassie gave me this for my birthday.\\nBy the way, I love that suit!\\nThanks, man.\\nI wish I had a suit.\\nI would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know?\\nOr maybe even just a suit, with no powers.\\nWhat is it?\\nDon\\'t know.\\nIt\\'s them!\\nThey can\\'t be far.\\nAll right, Hank. Hank?\\nDad, what\\'s your status?\\nFoster\\'s taken care of.\\nSuiting up now.\\nI just wanted to save Ava.\\nShe\\'s facing death or something far more terrible.\\nShe\\'s afraid.\\nI\\'ll help you find a cure when I get back.\\nI promise.\\nTogether, we\\'ll figure something out.\\nGood luck, Hank.\\nThanks, Bill.\\nNow, I\\'m gonna need you to step back.\\nTime remaining, 15 minutes.\\nHank\\'s in, Scott.\\nAny sign of her?\\nNo, nothing yet.\\nAva!\\nCall off the ants, Scott.\\nOh, boy!\\nCan I get a status report?\\n\\'Cause I got some serious Ghost problems here!\\nReady to dive.\\n- In case I don\\'t make it... - Don\\'t.\\nDon\\'t say that.\\nI can\\'t lose you, too.\\nI love you, Hope.\\nGuys, everything\\'s bad over here.\\nNow.\\nMisdirection.\\nOne of the first things they teach you\\nat Online Close-up Magic University.\\nNo!\\nPlan worked. We got it, Scotty!\\nMeet us at the rendezvous point.\\nOkay, on my way!\\nOh, no.\\nReally? This guy again?\\nWho?\\nI told you our business wasn\\'t over.\\nChange of plans.\\nHang on.\\nI want that lab, boys, whatever it takes.\\nHold on.\\nThat undercarriage is filthy!\\nOh, they got bigger problems.\\nHope, what\\'re you doing?\\nYou\\'re heading away from the rendezvous point!\\nDon\\'t worry,\\nI\\'m taking these guys on the scenic route.\\nWait, what\\'re you... Oh.\\nOh, my God! Oh, my God! We\\'re gonna die!\\nWe\\'re gonna die!\\nSignal lost.\\nWhat the hell are they doing up there?\\nRecalibrating.\\nRecalibrating.\\nYou never said it was so beautiful, Scott.\\nRecalibrating.\\nOkay, any time now.\\nRecalibrating.\\n- Recalibrating. - Come on.\\nSignal restored.\\nBikes, it\\'s all you.\\n- Take the wheel. - What? Wait! Whoa.\\nWell, the 60\\'s were fun, but now I\\'m paying for it.\\nBe careful up there!\\nHey, give me a break! I haven\\'t driven in two years!\\nOh, you got pezed!\\nUp here!\\nOh, that\\'s not good.\\nHope!\\n- No! - No!\\nThere it is, right there. Get the lab!\\nGet the lab!\\nI\\'ve got her. Westbound on Fremont.\\nHope! Wait!\\nHey, what about me?\\nWe got you now, Ava!\\nWhoa! Oh!\\nNot again!\\nPiece of junk!\\nAh! Yes!\\nGo, go, go, go, go!\\nBurch got the lab.\\nI\\'m going after him.\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!\\nWork in progress, my ass...\\nScott, where are you?\\nI\\'ve got Burch in my sights. Hurry!\\nI\\'m coming, I\\'m coming, I\\'m coming!\\nWe\\'re running out of time.\\nWarning, approaching quantum void.\\nI\\'m coming to you, honey.\\nGuys.\\nDon\\'t you need the remote to the lab? I just found it.\\nWe can\\'t grow the lab without it.\\nGet it to us fast.\\nYeah, but the van is busted.\\nUse the Hot Wheels Rally case.\\nWhat?\\nI love you, Dr. Pym.\\nThe remote! We\\'re missing the remote!\\nYou gotta check the van!\\nHuh?\\nAwesome!\\nHey, I\\'m going down Pacific.\\nBurch\\'s boys are all over me.\\nI\\'m on my way.\\nRight. I\\'ll get the lab.\\nHi.\\nOh, that\\'s badass!\\nNice.\\nDoink!\\nCome here, you little weasel!\\nNo, you don\\'t!\\nI guess maybe you do.\\nCome on!\\nAnyone see a Southern gentleman carrying a building?\\nHow\\'d he even have time to buy a ticket?\\nWould you just one time,\\nplease work!\\nYes!\\nAll right, I need help.\\nYes!\\nOh. Sorry. Ah...\\nSomebody!\\nHey! Come on, man!\\nNot cool!\\nMurderers!\\nYes, yes, yes, yes!\\nI\\'m gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas!\\nYou\\'re a badass!\\nYes!\\nNo, no, no!\\nAnt-onio!\\nOur friends, the humpbacks,\\ndip in here to the San Francisco Bay...\\nfor a little leisure and a little breeding.\\nListen, Uzman...\\nAnd perhaps they\\'re down below as we speak, doing the nasty.\\nJust meet me at the waterfront.\\nIn three hours.\\nOh, folks. We\\'ve barely left the dock...\\nbut it looks like we got some company.\\nLook. Right there. Do you see it, folks?\\nThere it is. There\\'s a breach.\\nWhat the...?\\nHi. Sorry. Hi.\\nIt\\'s okay. It\\'s okay!\\nSorry, I know I\\'m not a whale. This will just take a second.\\nHey! That doesn\\'t belong to you!\\nNo, no! No, no!\\nYou\\'re embarrassing yourself now\\nCome on. Let go.\\nThank you.\\nI\\'ll take this now.\\nIt melts your mind.\\nA message in your head.\\nI had a dream.\\nDaddy? Where\\'s Mommy?\\nIt\\'s where I hid every time that we played.\\nI love you, Hank.\\nDaddy?\\nDaddy?\\nDad? What\\'s going on?\\nWhy haven\\'t you found Mom?\\nYou look lost, Hank. Are you all right?\\nStill think you have all the answers, Hank?\\nIt\\'s me.\\nI\\'m so sorry...\\nit took so long.\\nNo.\\nNo.\\nYou\\'re here now.\\nLet\\'s go home.\\nI thought I was gone.\\nBut that energy from your hands...\\nhow did you do that?\\nI\\'m not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry.\\nThis place...\\nit changes you.\\nAdaptation is part of it, but some of it is...\\nevolution.\\nLab coordinates not found.\\nDo not ascend.\\nI should probably tell you\\nwhat we\\'re dealing with up there.\\nI got the lab. I got the lab.\\nMove. Move.\\nMove!\\nGet out of the way.\\nLet\\'s go.\\nNo one here appears to be sure what this is.\\nIt\\'s gotta be 80-85 feet tall.\\nGet out of the way!\\nI got the lab.\\nThe air feels chunky.\\nOh, no. He\\'s too big.\\nScotty!\\nScott!\\nI\\'m gonna go to sleep.\\nI\\'m just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes.\\nI just need five minutes.\\nFive minutes!\\nYou get the lab somewhere safe.\\n- Scott\\'s air won\\'t last. - Okay.\\nMove!\\nMove! Move!\\nNo, wait!\\nLab at full scale.\\nThey did it.\\nReady to ascend.\\nLet\\'s go see our daughter.\\nScott!\\nScott!\\nScott, come on, wake up!\\nCome on. Come on, where are you, Scott?\\nGotcha.\\nScott?\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nHey, Scotty! Hope, come in.\\nDid you get crushed by the building?\\nWhere\\'s the remote, Luis?\\nIt\\'s probably in there.\\nI don\\'t have it.

Reading?\\nI\\'ve done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.\\nHave you?\\nDoes Odin share your concern?\\nDoes Thor?\\nIt must be so inconvenient, them asking after me day and night.\\nYou know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\\nMy actions?\\nI was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life...\\nThat I was born to be a king.\\nA king?\\nA true king admits his faults.\\nWhat of the lives you took on Earth?\\nA mere handful compared to the number\\nthat Odin has taken himself.\\n- Your father... - He\\'s not my father!\\nThen am I not your mother?\\nYou\\'re not.\\nYou\\'re always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.\\nWhen you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.\\nHeimdall had lost sight of you.\\nYou were no longer on Earth.\\nHow is that possible?\\nI believe you were and you weren\\'t.\\nThe Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil\\norbiting Midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun.\\nAnd every 5,000 years, the worlds align perfectly\\nand we call this the Convergence.\\nDuring this time, the borders between worlds become blurred.\\nIt\\'s possible you found one of these points.\\nWe are lucky that it remained open.\\nOnce the worlds pass out of alignment\\nthen the connection is lost.\\nI like the way you explain things.\\nWhat\\'s going to happen to me?\\nI\\'ll find a way to save you, Jane.\\n- Your father said there was... - My father doesn\\'t know everything.\\nDon\\'t let him hear you say that.\\nJane Foster... Please meet Frigga,\\nQueen of Asgard, and my mother.\\nHi.\\nMove!\\nTo the dungeons!\\nCome on!\\nYou might want to take the stairs to the left.\\nThe prisons.\\n- Loki... - Go.\\nI will look after her.\\nIt\\'s as if they resent being imprisoned!\\n- There\\'s no pleasing some creatures.\\nReturn to your cells, no further harm will come to you.\\nYou have my word.\\nVery well, you do not have my word.\\nSend a squadron to the weapons vault.\\nDefend it at all costs. Secure the dungeon.\\n- Odin. - Frigga.\\nGo!\\nIt\\'s a skirmish.\\nNothing to fear.\\nYou\\'ve never been a very good liar.\\nTake her to your chambers.\\nI\\'ll come for you when it\\'s safe.\\nYou take care.\\nDespite all I have survived,\\nmy queen still worries over me.\\nIt\\'s only because I worry over you\\nthat you have survived.\\nListen to me now.\\nI need you to do everything I ask, no questions.\\nYes, ma\\'am.\\nOh!\\n- Ow! - Ah!\\nThe throne of Asgard is destroyed! To the king!\\nFrigga.\\nStand down, creature,\\nand you may still survive this.\\nI have survived worse, woman.\\nWho are you?\\nI am Malekith.\\nAnd I would have what is mine.\\nAh!\\nYou have taken something, child.\\nGive it back.\\nWitch!\\nWhere is the Aether?\\nI\\'ll never tell you.\\nI believe you.\\nNo!\\nThe universe rotates on a 5,000 year cycle\\nand once a cycle, all the worlds align.\\nImagine... Imagine that this is our world.\\nOh, thank you. And this is another world.\\nNormally, they\\'re separate.\\nBut during the Alignment,\\neverything is connected, all nine realms.\\nAll nine realms are passing through each other\\nand gravity, light, and even matter,\\nis crashing from one world to the other.\\nBut if this happens to us now, the result will be cataclysmic.\\nMy gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence.\\nThis time, the Alignment\\nand all the other worlds would just pass us by.\\nIt\\'s beautiful.\\nIt\\'s simple. Any questions?\\nYeah.\\nCan I have my shoe back?\\nHeal. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether.\\nAnd when you wake, we will kill them all.\\nJane Foster?\\nYou need to come with us.\\nWe are still unable to restore the palace shields.\\nOur artillery cannot detect them.\\nEven Heimdall cannot see them.\\nMy king, we are all but defenseless.\\nShe\\'s your prisoner now?\\nLeave us.\\nI do not wish to fight with you.\\nNor I with you.\\nBut I intend to pursue Malekith.\\nWe possess the Aether.\\nMalekith will come to us.\\nYes, and he will destroy us.\\nYou overestimate the power of these creatures.\\nNo, I value our people\\'s lives.\\nI\\'ll take Jane to the Dark World, and draw the enemy away from Asgard.\\nWhen Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane,\\nit will be exposed and vulnerable.\\nAnd I will destroy it and him.\\nIf you fail, you risk this weapon\\nfalling into the hands of our enemies.\\nThe risk is far greater if we do nothing.\\nHis ship could be over our heads right now,\\nwe would never even know it.\\nIf and when he comes\\nhis men will fall on 10,000 Asgardian blades.\\nAnd how many of our men shall fall on theirs?\\nAs many as are needed!\\nAh!\\nWe Will fight!\\nTill the last Asgardian breath.\\nTill the last drop of Asgardian blood.\\nThen how are you different from Malekith?\\nThe difference, my son, is that I will win.\\nJane isn\\'t calling me back, Erik isn\\'t calling me back,\\nstupid S.H.I.E.L.D. isn\\'t calling me back.\\n- What\\'s S.H.I.E.L.D? - It\\'s a secret.\\nHey, Erik, it\\'s Darcy again.\\nThor came back, he took Jane to Asgard,\\nand I\\'m not sure what I\\'m supposed to do.\\nSomething else went missing this week\\nwhen astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig\\nnotable for his involvement in the alien invasion of New York\\nstreaked nude across...\\nDarcy, you really need to look at this.\\nYour friend, Erik...\\nWhat was his last name again?\\nAnd began shouting at visitors to the historic site.\\nHe was later taken into police custody\\nfor psychiatric evaluation.\\nPolice are still refusing to confirm...\\nYou were not at Odin\\'s war council.\\nThe Bifrost is closed by your father\\'s orders.\\nNo one is to come or to go.\\nWe face an enemy that is invisible even to me.\\nWhat use is a guardian such as that?\\nMalekith will return, you know this.\\nI need your help.\\nI cannot overrule my king\\'s wishes. Not even for you.\\nI\\'m not asking you to.\\nThe realms need their Allfather strong and unchallenged\\nwhether he is or not.\\nBut he is blinded, Heimdall\\nby hatred and by grief.\\nAs are we all.\\nI see clearly enough.\\nThe risks are too great.\\nEverything we do from here on is a risk.\\nThere is no other way.\\nWhat do you require of me?\\nWhat I\\'m about to ask of you is treason of the highest order.\\nSuccess will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death.\\nMalekith knew the Aether was here. He can sense its power.\\nIf we do nothing, he will come for it again\\nbut this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.\\nWe must move Jane off-world.\\nThe Bifrost has been shut down\\nand the Tesseract locked away in the vault.\\nThere are other paths off Asgard. Ways known only to a few.\\nOne, actually.\\nNo.\\nThor. After all this time\\nand now you come to visit me.\\nWhy?\\nHave you come to gloat? To mock?\\nLoki, enough.\\nNo more illusions.\\nNow you see me, brother.\\nDid she suffer?\\nI did not come here to share our grief.\\nInstead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\\nGo on.\\nI know you seek vengeance as much as I do.\\nYou help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.\\nVengeance and afterward, this cell.\\nYou must be truly desperate to come to me for help.\\nWhat makes you think you can trust me?\\nI don\\'t.\\nMother did.\\nBut you should know that when we fought each other in the past,\\nI did so with a glimmer of hope\\nthat my brother was still in there somewhere.\\nThat hope no longer exists to protect you.\\nYou betray me, and I will kill you.\\nHmm.\\nWhen do we start?\\nHe will betray you.\\nHe will try.\\nThis is so unlike you, brother.\\nSo clandestine.\\nAre you sure you wouldn\\'t rather just punch your way out?\\nIf you keep speaking, I just might.\\nFine. As you wish.\\nI\\'m not even here.\\nIs this better?\\nIt\\'s better company at least.\\nStill, we could be less conspicuous.\\nMmm, brother, you look ravishing.\\nIt will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.\\nVery well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions\\ngiven that you seem to like them so much.\\nOh, this is much better.\\nOoh.\\nThe costume is a bit much. So tight.\\nBut the confidence...\\nI can feel the righteousness surging.\\nHey, do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth?\\nHonor? Patriotism?\\nGod bless Amer...\\nWhat?\\nYou could at least furnish me with a weapon.\\nMy dagger, something.\\nAt last.\\nA little common sense.\\nAnd I thought you liked tricks.\\nWell, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of Einherjar\\nwho will see you coming from Miles away.\\nI won\\'t be the one who comes for her.\\nI\\'m not hungry.\\nWhat the... Good. Let\\'s go.\\nYou\\'re...\\nI\\'m Loki, you may have heard of me.\\nThat was for New York.\\nI like her.\\nAnd what of the Allfather?\\nIt is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.\\nYou called me here on an urgent matter.\\nWhat is it?\\nTreason, my lord.\\nWhose\\'?\\nMine.\\nMy king!\\nThe mortal has been taken.\\nStop Thor.\\nBy any means necessary.\\nThere they are! Take them.\\nOn my command.\\nI\\'ll hold them off. Take her.\\nThank you.\\nBetray him, and I\\'ll kill you.\\nIt\\'s good to see you, too, Sif.\\nAssuming you can get Loki\\'s help and you can free this mortal\\nwhat good would it do?\\nWe\\'d all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.\\nThat, my friend, is why we won\\'t be leaving by foot.\\nI will give you as much time as I can.\\nThank you, my friend.\\nIf you even think about betraying him...\\nYou\\'ll kill me?\\nEvidently, there will be a line.\\nI thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.\\nI said, \"How hard could it be?\"\\nThey\\'re on the ship!\\nGet to the ship!\\nWell, whatever you\\'re doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.\\n- Shut up, Loki.\\nYou must have missed something.\\nNo, I didn\\'t. I\\'m pressing every button on this thing.\\nNo, don\\'t hit it. Just press it gently.\\nI\\'m pressing it gently, it\\'s networking!\\nHa, ha!\\nGet him! Get him!\\n- I think you missed a column. - Shut up!\\nLook, why don\\'t you let me take over?\\nI\\'m clearly the better pilot.\\nIs that right? Well, out of the two of us,\\nwhich one can actually fly?\\nOh, dear. Is she dead?\\nJane.\\nI\\'m okay.\\nAh!\\nNot a word.\\nNow they\\'re following us.\\nNow they\\'re firing at us.\\nYeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki,\\nit\\'s not at all distracting!\\nWell done. You just decapitated your grandfather.\\nYou know, this is wonderful.\\nThis is a tremendous idea.\\nLet\\'s steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe\\nand escape in that.\\nFlying around the city,\\nsmashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us.\\nIt\\'s brilliant, Thor! It\\'s truly brilliant!\\nI see your time in the dungeons\\nhas made you no less graceful, Loki.\\nYou lied to me.\\nI\\'m impressed.\\nI\\'m glad you\\'re pleased.\\nNow, do as you promised.\\nAnd take us to your secret pathway.\\n- Fandral. - Right.\\nFor Asgard.\\nNothing personal, boys.\\nLoki...\\nIf it were easy, everyone would do it.\\n- Are you mad? - Possibly.\\nLON\\'. Ya-den!\\nWe must strike now.\\nNo.\\nAsgard is meaningless.\\nThe Aether has found its way home.\\nWhat I could do with the power that flows through those veins.\\nIt would consume you.\\nShe\\'s holding up all right.\\nFor now.\\nShe\\'s strong in ways you\\'d never even know.\\nSay goodbye.\\nNot this day.\\nThis day, the next, a hundred years, it\\'s nothing.\\nIt\\'s a heartbeat.\\nYou\\'ll never be ready.\\nThe only woman whose love you\\'ve prized\\nwill be snatched from you.\\nAnd will that satisfy you?\\nSatisfaction is not in my nature.\\nSurrender is not in mine.\\n- The son of Odin... - No.\\nNot just of Odin.\\nYou think you alone were loved of Mother?\\nYou had her tricks, but I had her trust.\\nTrust?\\nWas that her last expression?\\nTrust? When you let her die?\\n- What help were you in your cell? - Who put me there?\\nWho put me there?\\nYou know damn well!\\n- You know damn well who!\\nShe wouldn\\'t want us to fight.\\nWell, she wouldn\\'t exactly be shocked.\\nI wish I could trust you.\\nTrust my rage.\\nYou\\'ll have to sign for your father\\'s belongings, Mr. Selvig.\\nWhat?\\nOh, yeah.\\nMy father, Dr. Erik Selvig.\\nOne man\\'s leather wallet, brown.\\nOne key ring, three keys.\\nPrescription medicine...\\nVarious.\\n- And... - Erik.\\n- These. - Yeah.\\nThose.\\nThank goodness.\\nErik.\\nYes?\\nIt\\'s, uh, Darcy.\\nDarcy.\\nSo good to see you.\\nOh, I missed you, too.\\nHow did you find me?\\nYou were naked on TV.\\nOkay, time to go, lots to do.\\nGetting weird now.\\nI should not be left in charge of stuff like this.\\nI don\\'t get paid enough. I don\\'t get paid, period.\\nI\\'m Ian by the way, uh, Darcy\\'s intern.\\nYeah, I don\\'t get paid either.\\nAre you all right?\\nI\\'ve had a God in my brain.\\n- I don\\'t recommend it.\\nDr. Selvig, sir, your gear is beeping at me.\\nIt\\'s happening. It\\'s sooner than I calculated.\\nWait. What\\'s happening?\\nBirds?\\nBirds are happening?\\nThey\\'re starlings. It\\'s called a murmuration.\\nMy dad, he used to take me bird watching as a kid.\\n- Nerd. - Look!\\nWhere did they go?\\nWhat the hell was that?\\nWhy are you smiling?\\nThere\\'s nothing more reassuring\\nthan realizing that the world is crazier than you are.\\nTake me to Jane\\'s lab.\\nJane.\\nMalekith.\\nAll right. Are you ready?\\nI am.\\nYou know, this plan of yours is going to get us killed.\\nYes, possibly.\\nYou still don\\'t trust me, brother?\\nWould you?\\nNo, I wouldn\\'t.\\nThor!\\nNo!\\nYou really think I cared about Frigga?\\nAbout any of you?\\nAll I ever wanted\\nwas you and Odin dead at my feet!\\nMalekith!\\nI am Loki of Jotunheim,\\n- and I bring you a gift.\\nI ask only one thing in return...\\nA good seat from which\\n- to watch Asgard burn.\\nHe is an enemy of Asgard.\\nHe was a prisoner in their dungeons.\\nLook at me.\\nLoki! NOW!\\nAh!\\nAh!\\n- Ah! - No!\\nSee you in hell, monster.\\nNo. No, no, no.\\nOh, you fool, you didn\\'t listen.\\nI know...\\nI\\'m a fool, I\\'m a fool.\\nStay with me, okay?\\nI\\'m sorry.\\n- I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. - Shh...\\nIt\\'s okay.\\nIt\\'s all right.\\nI\\'ll tell Father what you did here today.\\nI didn\\'t do it for him.\\nNo!\\nHe\\'s going to unleash it.\\nNot just on Asgard, or on a star. Malekith is going to destroy everything.\\nHow?\\nJane, how?\\nI saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?\\nThe Convergence.\\nOh, God.\\nNone of this would have happened if I hadn\\'t found the Aether.\\nThen Malekith would\\'ve only possessed it\\nthat much sooner.\\nI only found it because I was looking for you.\\nJane.\\nNow we\\'re trapped here.\\nIt\\'s not me.\\nHello?\\nHi, Jane, it\\'s Richard.\\nRichard? Where are you?\\nI\\'m still at the office.\\nIt\\'s been a crazy day here today.\\n- Oh, my God, this is amazing. - Is it?\\nI quite enjoyed our lunch\\ndespite never actually ordering anything.\\nHow am I getting service here?\\nIs this a bad time? Do you want me to try you later?\\nNo, no, no. Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.\\nOkay, then.\\nI was just wondering if you want to try again.\\nUh, maybe dinner next time.\\nUh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\n- Just stay on the phone, okay? - Yeah, I will.\\nOn, my God.\\nAm I interrupting something?\\nNo, no, no. Nothing at all.\\nCome on.\\nI\\'m losing you there. Are you in a tunnel?\\nWhere are we going?\\nHello?\\nWhy are there so many shoes in here?\\nI\\'ll just text her.\\nSo, who\\'s Richard?\\nReally?\\n- Jane! - Hey.\\nYou can\\'t just leave like that.\\nThe whole world is going crazy.\\nAll the stuff we saw is spreading.\\n- Did you go to a party? - Erik?\\nJane! How wonderful.\\nOh!\\n- You\\'ve been to Asgard. - Where are your pants?\\nOh, he, uh... He says it helps him think.\\nOkay, well, I\\'m going to need everything you got on this.\\nAll the work you\\'ve been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.\\nOkay.\\n- Are you well, Erik?\\nYour brother\\'s not coming, is he?\\nLoki is dead.\\nOh, thank God!\\nI... I meant, I\\'m so sorry.\\nThank you.\\nForgive me, my liege.\\nI\\'ve returned from the Dark World with news.\\nThor?\\nThere was no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but...\\nWhat?\\nWe found a body.\\nLoki.\\nMalekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot\\nwhere all the nine worlds are connecting.\\nAmplifying the weapon\\'s impact.\\nFor each additional world,\\nthe power will increase exponentially.\\nThe effect would be universal.\\nBut the Alignment is only temporary.\\nHe must be in exactly the right place at the right time.\\nWell, how do we know where that is?\\nWe follow the directions.\\nThis has happened before\\nthousands of years ago, and the Ancients were there to see it.\\nAll the great constructions,\\nthe Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.\\nThey made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence.\\nAnd they left us a map.\\nStonehenge,\\nSnow-don, the Great Orme.\\nThese are all coordinates taking us...\\nHere.\\nGreenwich?\\nThe walls between worlds will be almost non-existent.\\nPhysics is going to go ballistic.\\nIncreases and decreases in gravity,\\nspatial extrusions.\\nThe very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart.\\nI better get my pants.\\nFocus! This is important.\\nWe have to hammer them in all around the site\\nand then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.\\nThey\\'re taped together.\\nDo you even know what these things do?\\nUh... No.\\nNeither do I.\\nShh!\\n- Come on, come on, come on! - Right.\\nHoly... Shit.\\nAh!\\nYou needn\\'t have come so far, Asgardian.\\nDeath would\\'ve come to you soon enough.\\nNot by your hand.\\nYour universe was never meant to be.\\nYour world and your family\\nwill be extinguished!\\nWe\\'re running out of time.\\n- Almost there. - Are you sure this is going to work?\\nThese devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.\\nOh, come on.\\nCome on, Darcy.\\nYou know, with all that power,\\nI thought you\\'d hit harder.\\nDone.\\nThe Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.\\nThat just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight.\\nOkay, you might want to hold on to something.\\nThat is awesome!\\nHow did you do that?\\nWell, the gravitational fields\\ninteract with the weak spots between worlds, creating...\\nOoh, get the guy with the sword!\\n- Oops. - Let\\'s go.\\nUm...\\n- What the hell just happened?\\nMove!\\nWhat are you all doing?\\nYou need to get out of here, now!\\nYou\\'re joking, right?\\nThat\\'s Thor out there.\\nHe\\'s waving his hammer around and everything!\\nAh!\\nConfirming ship is hostile.\\nConfirmed, ship is hostile.\\nYou have permission to engage.\\nRoger.\\nMissiles locked.\\nMissiles away.\\nMissiles off target.\\nI repeat, target missed. I\\'m losing control.\\nMayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nMy signal\\'s not connecting.\\nJane!\\nCome on.\\nAre you all right?\\nYou saved my life.\\nYeah.\\nI guess I did.\\nMmm.\\nDarcy?\\n- Jane!\\n- Ian! - Selvig!\\nMew mew!\\nMind the gap.\\nHow do I get to Greenwich?\\nTake this train. Three stops.\\nMind the gap.\\nSorry. Sorry.\\n- We\\'re out of time. - Jane.\\nJane!\\nThor!\\nWe\\'re too late.\\nThe Convergence is at its peak.\\nCan those things stop him?\\nNot from here.\\nWe can\\'t get close enough.\\nI can.\\nMalekith!\\nDarkness returns, Asgardian.\\nHave you come to witness the end of your universe?\\nI\\'ve come to accept your surrender.\\nYou think you can stop this?\\nThe Aether cannot be destroyed.\\nBut you can.\\nThor! No.\\nJane!\\nAh!\\nEverybody okay?\\nHe\\'s gonna come back.\\nExcept, you know,\\nlast time he was gone for, like, two years.\\nWell, it\\'s only been two days, so...\\nDid he say anything before he left?\\nYeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father.\\nHe kinda committed treason... On our way out.\\nOh.\\nYou once said there would never be a wiser king than me.\\nYou were wrong.\\nThe Alignment has brought all the realms together.\\nEvery one of them saw you offer your life to save them.\\nWhat can Asgard offer its new king in return?\\nMy life.\\nFather, I cannot be king of Asgard.\\nI will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath,\\nbut I cannot do so from that chair.\\nLoki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will.\\nThe brutality, the sacrifice...\\nIt changes you.\\nI\\'d rather be a good man than a great king.\\nIs this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?\\nWhen you speak, do I never hear Mother\\'s voice?\\nThis is not for Jane, Father.\\nShe does not know what I came here to say.\\nNow, forbid me to see her, or say she can rule at my side.\\nIt changes nothing.\\nOne son who wanted the throne too much,\\nanother who will not take it.\\nIs this my legacy?\\nLoki died with honor.\\nI shall try to live the same.\\nIs that not legacy enough?\\nIt belongs to you.\\nIf you are worthy of it.\\nI shall try to be.\\nI cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.\\nI know.\\nIf I were proud of the man my son had become,\\neven that, I could not say.\\nIt would speak only from my heart.\\nGo,\\nmy son.\\nThank you, Father.\\nNo.\\nThank you.\\nI present to you,\\nTaneleer Tivan, the Collector.\\nWhoa...\\nAsgardians, it\\'s an honor.\\nYou know why we\\'re here.\\nOf course.\\nBut, if I may ask,\\nwhy not keep it secure in your own vault?\\nThe Tesseract is already on Asgard.\\nIt is not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.\\nThat\\'s very wise.\\nI can assure you,\\nit will be absolutely safe here,\\nin my collection.\\nSee that it is.\\nOne down.\\nFive to go.On your left.\\nOn your left.\\nOn my left.

Why?\\n- What\\'s on it? - I don\\'t know.\\nStop lying.\\nI only act like I know everything, Rogers.\\nI bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn\\'t you?\\nWell, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.\\nI\\'m not gonna ask you again.\\nI know who killed Fury.\\nMost of the intelligence community doesn\\'t believe he exists.\\nThe ones that do call him the Winter Soldier.\\nHe\\'s credited with over two dozen assassinations\\nin the last 50 years.\\nSo he\\'s a ghost story.\\nFive years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran.\\nSomebody shot out my tires near Odessa.\\nWe lost control, went straight over a cliff.\\nI pulled us out.\\nBut the Winter Soldier was there.\\nI was covering my engineer so he shot him\\nstraight through me.\\nSoviet slug.\\nNo rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.\\nYeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.\\nGoing after him is a dead end. I know, I\\'ve tried.\\nLike you said, he\\'s a ghost story.\\nWell, let\\'s find out what the ghost wants.\\nNick Fury was murdered in cold blood.\\nTo any reasonable person,\\nthat would make him a martyr, not a traitor.\\nYou know what makes him a traitor?\\nHiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.\\nNick Fury used your friendship\\nto coerce this Council into delaying Project Insight.\\nA project he knew would expose his own illegal operations.\\nAt best, he lied to you. At worst...\\nAre you calling for my resignation?\\nI\\'ve got a pen and paper right here.\\nThat discussion can be tabled for a later time.\\nBut you do want to have a discussion?\\nWe\\'ve already had it, Mr. Secretary.\\nThis Council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight.\\nIf you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.\\nFirst rule of going on the run is don\\'t run, walk.\\nIf I run in these shoes, they\\'re gonna fall off.\\nThe drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up\\nS.H.I.E.L.D. will know exactly where we are.\\nHow much time will we have?\\nAbout nine minutes from\\nnow.\\nFury was right about that ship.\\nSomebody\\'s trying to hide something.\\nThis drive is protected by some sort of AI.\\nIt keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.\\nCan you override it?\\nThe person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.\\nSlightly.\\nI\\'m gonna try running a tracer.\\nThis is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed\\nto track hostile malware,\\nso if we can\\'t read the file,\\nmaybe we can find out where it came from.\\nCan I help you guys with anything?\\nNo. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.\\nRight.

Take your feet off the dash.\\nAll right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer.\\nI feel like, if you don\\'t answer it though,\\n- you\\'re kind of answering it, you know. - What?\\nWas that your first kiss since 1945?\\n- That bad, huh? - I didn\\'t say that.\\nWell, it kind of sounds like that\\'s what you\\'re saying.\\nNo, I didn\\'t.\\nI just wondered how much practice you\\'ve had.\\n- You don\\'t need practice. - Everybody needs practice.\\nIt was not my first kiss since 1945.\\nI\\'m 95, I\\'m not dead.\\nNobody special, though?\\nBelieve it or not, it\\'s kind of hard\\nto find someone with shared life experience.\\nWell, that\\'s all right.

How could it know?\\nHow could it not?\\nThe 21st century is a digital book.\\nZola taught HYDRA how to read it.\\nYour bank records,\\nmedical histories, voting patterns,\\nemails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores!\\nZola\\'s algorithm evaluates people\\'s past\\nto predict their future.\\nAnd what then?\\nOh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.\\nWhat then?\\nThen the Insight helicarriers scratch people off the list.\\nA few million at a time.\\nHYDRA doesn\\'t like leaks.\\nThen why don\\'t you try sticking a cork in it?\\nInsight\\'s launching in 16 hours.\\nWe\\'re cutting it a little bit close here.\\nI know.

Look at the coordinates.\\nFocus.\\nOpen, please.\\nThat\\'s it. That\\'s it.\\nYou\\'re almost there.\\nYou\\'re almost there. Don\\'t fight it.\\nFocus!\\nGet her back! Get her back now!\\nThis doesn\\'t make any sense.\\nDo we have any information we can act on?\\nJust that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53.\\nWe\\'re on our way.\\nThen dig, dig, dig deeper.\\nLawson is our link to that light-speed engine!\\nAnd everything we\\'re after.\\nOh!\\nThat did something.\\nTry that again.\\nNot yet!\\nWhat did you do to me?\\nNow we\\'re just after a little information.\\nWhat did you put in my head?\\nNothing that wasn\\'t already there.\\nBut those aren\\'t my memories.\\nYeah, it\\'s like a bad trip, isn\\'t it?\\nI\\'m not surprised you can\\'t keep it straight.\\nThey really did a number on you.\\nEnough of your mind games.\\nWhat do you want?\\nWe\\'re looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson...\\nand her light-speed engine.\\nI don\\'t know any Dr. Lawson.\\nReally? Then why is she in your head?\\nYou guys wouldn\\'t happen to know\\nhow these things come off, would ya?\\nNo?\\nFine.\\nHmm.\\nHey.\\nYou do know why they call it a...\\nYou leaving so soon?\\nWe\\'re just getting to know each other.\\nVers to Starforce command, do you read me?\\nHello? Do you copy?\\nHi. I\\'m Vers. Kree Starforce.\\nIs this C-53?\\nDo you understand me? Is my universal translator working?\\nYeah. I understand you.\\nOh, good.\\nAre you in charge of security for this district?\\nSort of. Uh, the movie theater has its own guy.\\nWhere can I find communications equipment?\\nThank you.\\nTrack the pod. Find the girl.\\nShe knows more than she knows.\\nHey.\\nThis one\\'s taken.\\nCome on.\\nVers?\\nVers?\\nVerify. CTC-39.\\nGRXV-1600.\\nAnd I\\'m fine, thank you for asking.\\nIs everyone okay? What happened?\\nSkrull ambush.\\nI thought we\\'d lost you.\\nDid you find Soh-Larr?\\nIt wasn\\'t Soh-Larr.\\nTalos simmed him. Even knew his code.\\nThat\\'s impossible.\\nThat code was buried in his unconscious.\\nThe Skrulls messed with my mind.\\nThe machine that they used...\\nI think it\\'s how they extracted Soh-Larr\\'s code.\\nVers, where are you?\\nI\\'m on planet C-53.\\nThe Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.\\nWho?\\nShe\\'s who I see.\\nShe\\'s what?\\nVers?\\nVers, what?\\nShe\\'s a scientist.\\nThey think that she\\'s cracked the code on light-speed tech.\\nI have to get to her before they do...\\nor else they\\'ll be able to invade new galaxies.\\nNo. You\\'ve been caught once already.\\nHow far is C-53?\\nClosest jump point is 22 hours.\\nVers, hold your position until we get there.\\nKeep your comms online so we can contact you.\\nNo! What if they get a hold of it before...\\nWe\\'re sorry.\\nA long-distance company access code\\nis required for the number you have dialed.\\n- Yon-Rogg? - Vers?\\nVers?\\nPlease dial your call with the access code.\\nVers?\\nIf the Skrulls got to her, she\\'s compromised.\\nShe\\'s stronger than you think.\\nEver been to C-53?\\nOnce.\\nIt\\'s a real shithole.\\nHey, rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop.\\nDid you call this in?\\nBeacon activated.\\nExcuse me, miss.\\nYou know anything about a lady blowing a hole...\\nthrough the roof of that Blockbuster over there?\\nWitness says she was dressed for laser tag.\\nOh.\\nYeah, I think she went that way.\\nUh, I\\'d like to ask you some questions.\\nMaybe give you the 411 on the late-night drop box.\\nCould I see some identification, please?\\nVers. Kree Starforce.\\nWe don\\'t carry our identification\\non little cards.\\nVers?\\nStarforce?\\nHow long you plan to be in town?\\noh, I\\'ll be out of your hair...\\nas soon as I track down the Skrulls\\nthat are infiltrating your planet.\\nSkrulls?\\nShapeshifters?\\nThey can transform into any life-form down to the DNA.\\nOh, boy. You guys don\\'t have any clue, do you?\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.\\nHow do we know you\\'re not one of those shapeshifters?\\nCongratulations, Agent Fury.\\nYou have finally asked a relevant question.\\nNo! Congratulations to you, Starforce lady.\\nYou\\'re under arrest.\\nRook!\\nRook, let\\'s roll!\\nDid you see her weapon?\\nI did not.\\nWatch it!\\nSuspect on northbound train. In pursuit.\\n\"Trust me, true believer.\" \"Trust me.\"\\n\"Trust me, true believer.\"\\nGet off!\\nTrain\\'s heading for a tunnel up ahead.\\nLet\\'s greet them at the station.\\nMr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.\\nUh, I\\'m still here at the Blockbuster.\\nAnd, uh, where\\'d everybody go?\\nI finished collecting evidence...\\nWe need an ambulance!\\nSomeone call 911!\\nHey! You all right?\\nOh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?\\nAnyone else see that?\\nOfficial S.H.I.E.L.D. activity. Stay back.\\nNice scuba suit.\\nLighten up, honey, huh?\\nGot a smile for me?\\nFreak.\\nAll life on Earth is carbon-based. Not this guy.\\nWhatever he runs on,\\nit\\'s not on the periodic table.\\nYou\\'re saying he\\'s not from around here?\\nHey, how\\'s your eye?\\nWell, I\\'d say fine...\\nbut it can\\'t believe what it\\'s seeing.\\nYou say this thing looked like Coulson?\\nMmm. Talked like him, too.\\nAnd the woman said that there were more?\\nThe word she used was \"infiltration.\"\\nYou believe her?\\nNot till I saw this.\\nWhat\\'s your plan?\\nI\\'ll find Blockbuster girl.\\nI got word on a motorcycle thief\\nthat fits her description.\\nIf she can tell us why these lizards are here...\\nmaybe she can tell us how to kick \\'em to the curb.\\nGood.\\nDo it alone, though. We can\\'t trust anyone.\\nNot even our own men.\\nYes, sir.\\nWow. They\\'re ugly bastards, aren\\'t they?\\nYeah, well, he\\'s no Brad Pitt, sir.\\nSafe journey to the beyond, my friend.\\nI will finish what we started.\\nI wouldn\\'t get too close there, boss.\\nNo one in or out.\\nBoom!\\nWhat can I get ya?\\nWhere was this photograph taken?\\nAn airport.\\nWhere\\'s Pegasus?\\nThat\\'s classified.\\nNot unlike the file I started on you.\\nBut I see you\\'ve changed it up a bit since then.\\nGrunge is a good look for you.\\nDid you have a rough day, Agent Fury?\\nIt was cool, you know?\\nHad a space invasion, big car chase.\\nGot to watch an alien autopsy.\\nTypical nine-to-five.\\nSo you saw one?\\nI was never one to believe in aliens...\\nbut I can\\'t unsee that.\\nThis is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask.\\nYou think I\\'m one of those green things.\\nCan\\'t be too careful.\\nYou are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man.\\nI\\'m afraid I\\'m gonna need proof.\\nWe talking cheek swab or urine sample?\\nNo. The DNA would match.\\nWant my AOL password?\\nSkrulls can only sim recent memories\\n- of their host bodies. - Oh, oh.\\nYou wanna get personal.\\n- Where were you born? - Huntsville, Alabama.\\nBut technically, I don\\'t remember that part.\\n- Name of your first pet? - Mr. Snoofers.\\n- Mr. Snoofers? - That\\'s what I said.\\nDo I pass?\\nNot yet. First job?\\nSoldier. Straight out of high school.\\nLeft the ranks a full bird colonel.\\n- Then? - Spy.\\n- Where? - It was the Cold War.\\nWe were everywhere.\\nUh, Belfast. Bucharest. Belgrade. Budapest.\\nI like the B\\'s. I can make them rhyme.\\n- Now? - Been riding a desk\\nfor the past six years...\\ntrying to figure out where our\\nfuture enemies are coming from.\\nNever occurred to me\\nthey would be coming from above.\\nName a detail so bizarre\\na Skrull could never fabricate it.\\nIf toast is cut diagonally, I can\\'t eat it.\\nYou didn\\'t need that, did you?\\nNo. No, I didn\\'t. But I enjoyed it.\\nOkay. Your turn.\\nProve you\\'re not a Skrull.\\nAnd how is that supposed to prove to me\\nyou\\'re not a Skrull?\\nThat\\'s a photon blast.\\nAnd?\\nA Skrull can\\'t do that.\\nSo, a full bird colonel\\nturned spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...\\nmust have pretty high security clearance.\\nWhere\\'s Pegasus?\\nOkay. The Skrulls sim alien races\\nto infiltrate and take over planets.\\nAnd you\\'re a Kree? A race of noble warriors?\\nHeroes. Noble warrior heroes.\\nSo, um, what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?\\nThey believe that she developed\\na light-speed engine at Pegasus.\\nLight-speed engine?\\nGotta admit, that\\'s not\\nthe craziest thing I\\'ve heard today.\\nWell, it\\'s still early.\\nAnd you, what do you want?\\nTo stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.\\nAnd?\\nLook, war is a universal language.\\nI know a rogue soldier when I see one.\\nYou got a personal stake in this.\\nThis is government property.\\nTurn your vehicle around.\\nNicholas Joseph Fury. Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nPlace your thumb on the pad.\\nOne moment.\\nNicholas Joseph Fury. You have three names?\\nEverybody calls me Fury.\\nNot Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick. Just Fury.\\n- What does your mom call you? - Fury.\\n- What do you call her? - Fury.\\nWhat about your kids?\\nIf I have them, they\\'ll call me Fury.\\nYou are cleared for access.\\nThank you.\\nOh, hold up.\\nYou look like somebody\\'s disaffected niece.\\nPut that on.\\n- What is it? - It\\'s the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.\\nDoes, uh, announcing your identity on clothing\\nhelp with the covert part of your job?\\nSaid the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.\\nLose the flannel.\\nHow can I help you?\\nWe\\'re agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nWe\\'re looking for a woman named Lawson.\\nA Dr. Wendy Lawson.\\nDo you know her?\\nFollow me.\\nHmm.\\nYou familiar with the phrase \"welcome wagon\"?\\nNo.\\nWell, this ain\\'t it.\\nIs that a communicator?\\nYeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.\\nWho are you paging?\\nMy mom. Don\\'t worry. I didn\\'t mention you.\\nAfter you.\\nImpressive.\\nOh, you should see what I can do with a paperclip.\\nHey, there. How are you?\\nOh, my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you.\\nAren\\'t you the cutest little thing?\\nAren\\'t you cute? And what\\'s your name, huh?\\nWhat\\'s your name?\\n\"Goose.\" Cool name for a cool cat.\\nFury?\\nHmm?\\nI\\'ll be back.\\nOh! Let me get my fingerprint out.\\nJust let me unravel this puppy.\\nYou sat there and watched me play with tape?\\nWhen all you had to do was...\\nI didn\\'t wanna steal your thunder.\\nHuh. Lawson.\\nLawson\\'s plan for the light-speed engine.\\nI wonder why they terminated the project.\\nUm, maybe because she\\'s cuckoo.\\nKree glyphs?\\nHmm?\\nLawson is not cuckoo.\\nShe\\'s Kree.\\nWell, she\\'s dead.\\nWhat?\\nShe crashed the Asis aircraft\\ndoing an unauthorized test flight.\\nTook a pilot down with her.\\nThat\\'s why security here is so unfriendly.\\nThey\\'re covering up a billion-dollar mistake.\\nOh, and your light-speed engine is toast.\\nWhen did this crash happen?\\nSix years ago. 1989.\\nWho was the pilot?\\nUm, most of this thing\\'s redacted...\\nbut there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau.\\nLast person to see them alive.\\nYou okay?\\nMm-hmm.\\nBack in a minute.\\nThis isn\\'t about fighting wars.\\nIt\\'s about ending them.\\nI know Lawson was Kree.\\nShe was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash.\\nDo you know anything about this?\\nI just discovered a mission report\\nsent from C-53.\\nThere\\'s only so much\\nI\\'m cleared to tell you, Vers, but...\\nLawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell.\\nShe was working on a unique energy core.\\nExperimenting with tech\\nthat apparently could help us win the war.\\nShe still here?\\nShe\\'s cooperating with the investigation, sir.\\n- You men stay here. - Yes, sir.\\nI want to question her alone.\\nExcellent work, Nicholas.\\nDoes it say anything about me?\\nAnything about you? No, of course not.\\nWhy would it?\\nI found evidence that I had a life here.\\nOn C-53?\\nMar-Vell is who I see\\nwhen I visit the Supreme Intelligence.\\nI knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.\\nThis sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.\\nNo, it\\'s not. Because I remember. I was here.\\nStop. Remember your training.\\nKnow your enemy. It could be you.\\nDo not let your emotions override your judgment.\\nShe\\'s on sublevel six.\\nI\\'ll get off on five...\\nand take the stairs in case she makes a run for it.\\nDo a pincer move like we did in Havana.\\nRight. Like we did in Havana.\\nWe\\'re nearing the jump point.\\nLeave your beacon on so I can find you.\\nWe\\'ll get to the bottom of this, Vers.\\nTogether.\\nOkay.\\nVers!\\nVers!\\nFury\\'s colluding with the target.\\nThen why would he call us in?\\nAll I know is we take him in, too.\\nDead or alive.\\nDead or alive?\\nGo. Go, go!\\nWas it something I said?\\nMmm-mmm.\\nNow, you know, I don\\'t really need these to see...\\nbut they do kinda complete the look.\\nDon\\'t you think?\\nYou called them in?\\nMy bad.\\nCoulson, do you have eyes on them?\\nThey\\'re not down here.\\nLet\\'s try up there.\\n- What? - Your communicator.\\nYou obviously can\\'t be trusted with it.\\nDo you know how to fly this thing?\\nUh, we\\'ll see.\\nThat\\'s a yes or no question.\\nYes.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about!\\nWe got a stowaway.\\nHang on, Goose.\\nGoose.\\nNo, Goose.\\nWho\\'s a good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose?\\nYes, that\\'s right.\\nWho\\'s a good kitty, Goose?\\nYou the good kitty, that\\'s right.\\nSee anyone you know?\\nFunny story.\\nI arrived on Hala near dead. No memory.\\nThat was six years ago.\\nSo, you think you\\'re the pilot\\nthat went down with Dr. Lawson?\\nI\\'m saying the last person to see them alive\\ncould probably tell us.\\n- Maria Rambeau? - Mm-hmm.\\nSo, how do we get to Louisiana?\\nDue east. Hang a right at Memphis.\\nThat agent...\\nthat stopped the Skrulls from finding us?\\nCoulson. The new guy.\\nI guess he doesn\\'t hate me yet.\\nYeah, well, give him time.\\nI guess he had a feeling, you know?\\nWent with his gut against orders.\\nThat\\'s a really hard thing to do.\\nBut it\\'s what keeps us human.\\nI get in trouble for that. A lot.\\nOh, I can see that about you.\\nRescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls?\\nI\\'m guessing that\\'s not\\nstandard Kree operating procedure.\\nWell, I won\\'t tell your boss if you don\\'t tell mine.\\nRonan.\\nThe Accusers completed their operation...\\nbut the greater mission was a failure,\\nthanks to your team.\\nIt was a trap\\nto lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her.\\nGive us their location.\\nWe\\'ll take care of the terrorist threat.\\nBy bombing them out of the galaxy?\\nNo, we\\'ll handle this.\\nA cell of Skrulls anywhere\\nis a threat to Kree everywhere.\\nWhere are they?\\n- They are... - Lost.\\nThey are lost for now.\\nBut we will find them.\\nDo so, or we will.\\nMaintain the course for C-53.\\nExcuse me, I\\'m looking for Maria Rambeau.\\nAuntie Carol?\\nMom, it\\'s Auntie Carol!\\nI knew it! Everyone said you were dead!\\nBut we knew they were lying.\\nI\\'m not really who you think I am.\\nThat is the craziest shit I ever heard.\\nGreen transforming aliens? There\\'s no such thing.\\nYou are absolutely right, young lady.\\nThere is no such thing.\\n\\'Cause if there were,\\nwe would want to keep that to ourselves.\\nYou don\\'t believe me?\\nNo way!\\nThat\\'s so cool!\\nOh, she can do a lot more than make tea\\nwith those hands.\\nLike what? Show us.\\nMaybe later.\\nI kept all your stuff.\\nI\\'ll go get it.\\nYou want to give her a hand with that?\\nHmm?\\nYou don\\'t remember anything?\\nI see flashes.\\nLittle moments.\\nBut I can\\'t tell what\\'s real.\\nIf I could just piece together what happened that morning...\\nmaybe it\\'ll all make sense.\\nYou woke me up banging on my door at dawn.\\nYour usual move.\\nBack then, we had to get up so early.\\nThe Air Force still wasn\\'t letting women fly combat...\\nso testing Lawson\\'s planes was our only shot\\nat doing something that mattered.\\nYou wanted to race to base in your old Mustang...\\nand I wasn\\'t about to argue,\\n\\'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.\\nBut you cheated, took a shortcut.\\nSince when is a shortcut cheating?\\nSince it violates the predetermined\\nrules of engagement.\\nI definitely don\\'t remember those.\\nHmm. Of course you don\\'t.\\nWhen I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated.\\nShe said she had lives to save.\\nShe was trying to take the Asis up herself,\\nbut you said that...\\nIf there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.\\nYeah. Yep. Big hero moment.\\nThe kind of moment we\\'d both been waiting for.\\nThe doc was always unique. That\\'s why we liked her.\\nBut now you\\'re saying she\\'s from another planet.\\nI know this must be hard for you.\\nOh, what? This part right here?\\nNo. No. Mmm-mmm.\\nOh, what\\'s hard is losing my best friend...\\nin a mission so secret\\nthey act like it never even happened.\\nHard is knowing you were out there somewhere\\ntoo damn stubborn to die.\\nAnd now you come up in here after six years...\\nwith your supercharged fire hands...\\nand you expect me to call you...\\nI don\\'t even know what. Vers?\\nIs that really who you are now?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nCome look!\\nThis is me and you on Halloween.\\nI\\'m Amelia Earhart and you\\'re Janis Joplin.\\nOh, this is you when you were little.\\nYou didn\\'t get along with your parents...\\nso Mom said we became your real family.\\nThis is us on Christmas.\\nI got my favorite bunny slippers.\\nThis is another picture of you when you were little.\\nYou\\'ve always wanted to be a pilot.\\nAnd this is right after you graduated.\\nThis was your dog that you got for Christmas...\\nThis is a picture of everybody from your Air Force team.\\nAnd this is you with Mom\\nright after a good day of training.\\nThese were your three favorite guys.\\nOh, wait. I forgot.\\nYour jacket.\\nMom doesn\\'t let me wear it anymore\\nafter I spilled ketchup on it.\\nThat was all that survived the crash.\\nOr so we thought.\\nDon\\'t answer that.\\nIt\\'s just my neighbor.\\nThey can change into anyone.\\nHi there.\\nWhat do you want?\\n- Uh... - Hey, Tom.\\nThis is my friend, Carol.\\nOh. Pleased to meet you.\\nYowzers.\\nStatic electricity out here\\'s no joke.\\nI noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road...\\nand I was just wondering...\\nif you mind if I bring the boys over\\nto get a closer look-see?\\n- A closer look-see? - Yeah.\\nTo see the \"bird\" parked out by the road?\\nMmm.\\nYou\\'re really working overtime\\nto sell this one, aren\\'t you, Talos?\\nI\\'m sorry, Tom. This really isn\\'t a good time.\\nI\\'ll come by tomorrow, okay?\\n- Uh... - Okay.\\nYou know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors.\\nYou never know when you\\'re gonna need\\nto borrow some sugar.\\nNow, hang on a second.\\nBefore you go swinging those jazz hands around...\\nmaking a mess of your friend\\'s house...\\nIt\\'s a lovely home, miss.\\nOh, my God!\\nWhat the hell?\\nNo one\\'s gonna hurt the girl.\\nJust don\\'t kill me.\\nThat would really complicate the situation.\\nI\\'m about five seconds from complicating that wall\\nwith some ugly-ass Skrull brains.\\nI\\'m sorry I simmed your boss.\\nBut now I stand before you as my true self.\\nWithout deception.\\nAnd who is that out there?\\nOkay, that\\'s a fair point...\\nbut I\\'m sure that you understand\\nI had to take some precautions.\\nI saw you crush 20 of my best men\\nwith your hands bound.\\nI just wanna talk.\\nLast time we talked,\\nI ended up hanging from my ankles.\\nThat was before I knew who you were.\\nBefore I knew what made you different from the others.\\nI have an audio recording from Pegasus...\\nof your voice from a plane crash\\nsix years ago...\\non a device I believe you call a \"black box.\"\\nThey told me it was destroyed in the crash.\\nHow\\'d you get it?\\nShe don\\'t understand.\\nYoung lady, I have a special skill...\\nthat kind of allows me\\nto get into places I\\'m not supposed to be.\\nCall me \"young lady\" again...\\nI\\'m gonna put my foot in a place\\nit\\'s not supposed to be.\\nAm I supposed to guess where that is?\\nYour ass.\\nOkay, I get it. We\\'re all a little on edge here.\\nBut, look, I just need your help\\ndecoding some coordinates.\\nIf you\\'ll sit down and you\\'ll listen to this...\\nI assure you, it\\'ll be worth your while.\\nCall your buddy back inside and I\\'ll listen.\\nDeal.\\nOh, my God! Get that thing away.\\nHow\\'d that get in here?\\nHmm?\\nThe cat?\\nThis isn\\'t what you\\'re afraid of, is it?\\nThat\\'s not a cat.\\n- That\\'s a Flerken. - A Flerken?\\nMom?\\nMonica.\\n- Why can\\'t I listen, too? - Shh!\\nWhat\\'s happening?\\nIt\\'s loading.\\nPunch in the coordinates\\n5-2-2-9, negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.\\nCopy that. Where are we going, Doc?\\nMy laboratory.\\nYour laboratory? What do you mean?\\nOh, no.\\nIs that... Wait, what is that?\\nIt\\'s not showing up on my radar.\\nGo, Carol. Fly!\\nThat\\'s no MiG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?\\nThose are the bad guys. Fly faster now!\\nYes, ma\\'am.\\n- What do they want? - Me. My work.\\nI never should have brought you along.\\nHere come some G\\'s.\\nThey\\'re firing backwards. Hold on!\\nBail out! Bail out! Bail out!\\nStay with me, Lawson!\\nCarol, come in. Do you copy?\\nYeah, I copy. We hit ground.\\nCarol, are you okay? Do you copy?\\nYeah! I copy.\\nDoc?\\nYour blood.\\nIt\\'s blue.\\nYeah, but, uh, how\\'s my hair?\\nHelp me out, will ya?\\nI gotta destroy it before they get here.\\nLawson?\\nYou remember what I said about our work here?\\nWhat it\\'s for?\\nTo end wars?\\nYeah. But the wars are bigger than you know.\\nDamn it!\\nMy name is not Lawson.\\nMy real name is Mar-Vell,\\nand I come from a planet called Hala.\\nI would say that you\\'re delusional...\\nbut we just got shot down by a spaceship\\nand your blood is blue.\\nListen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war.\\nNow, skedaddle before you give me\\nany more regrets.\\nJust remember the coordinates, okay?\\nYou gotta save \\'em without me.\\nSave who? How?\\nNow I gotta blow this engine before they find it.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWe have no interest in hurting you.\\nNo?\\n\\'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!\\nThe energy core.\\nWhere is it?\\nPararescue\\'s on the way.\\nYou have two minutes until you\\'re surrounded.\\nThen I see no reason to prolong this conversation.\\nNo, wait!\\nYou mean that energy core?\\nNo!\\nCommander? She\\'s still moving. Permission to fire.\\nHold your fire.\\nThere\\'s nothing left.\\nThe core has been destroyed.\\nShe absorbed its power.\\nShe\\'s coming with us.\\nHe lied to me.\\nEverything that I knew was a lie.\\nNow, you understand.\\nWhat? What do I understand now?\\nYon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.\\nHe killed her...\\n\\'cause she found out that she was\\non the wrong side of an unjust war.\\nNo.\\nYour people are terrorists.\\nThey kill innocents.\\nI saw the ruins on Torfa.\\nRuins that the Accusers are responsible for.\\nMy people lived as refugees on Torfa.\\nHomeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule...\\nand they destroyed our planet.\\nAnd the handful of us that are left\\nwill be slaughtered next...\\nunless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started.\\nThe core that she found\\nwould have powered a light-speed ship...\\ncapable of carrying us to safety.\\nA new home where the Kree can\\'t reach us.\\nLawson always told us that our work at Pegasus\\nwasn\\'t to fight wars...\\nbut to end them.\\nShe wanted you to help us find the core.\\nWell, I already destroyed it.\\nNo, you destroyed the engine.\\nThe core that powered it is in a remote location.\\nIf you help us decode those coordinates...\\nwe can find it.\\nYou\\'ll use it to destroy us.\\nWe just want a home.\\nYou and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree.\\nCan\\'t you see it now?\\nYou\\'re not one of them.\\nYou don\\'t know me.\\nYou have no idea who I am.\\nI don\\'t even know who I am!\\nYou are Carol Danvers.\\nYou are the woman on that black box\\nrisking her life to do the right thing.\\nMy best friend...\\nwho supported me as a mother and a pilot\\nwhen no one else did.\\nYou are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass...\\nand you were the most powerful person I knew...\\nway before you could shoot fire from your fists.\\nYou hear me?\\nDo you hear me?\\nCome here. Come here, girl.\\nI got you.\\nI know I don\\'t deserve your trust...\\nbut you were our only lead.\\nWe discovered that your energy signature\\nmatched Mar-Vell\\'s core.\\nNow we know why.\\nIf only you knew the importance of it to me.\\nI just need your help\\ndecoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell\\'s lab.\\nThose weren\\'t coordinates. They\\'re state vectors.\\nFor orbital position and velocity.\\nYou didn\\'t find her lab on Earth,\\n\\'cause it\\'s not on Earth.\\nThat was the location\\non the date of the crash six years ago.\\nIf we track its course,\\nwe\\'ll find it in orbit right now.\\nIt\\'s just basic physics.\\nIn orbit?\\nWas that so difficult to figure out?\\nI mean, you\\'re my science guy, right?\\nYon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.\\nWe\\'ve got to get to the core before he does.\\nMmm. We\\'re going to space?\\nIn what?\\nA few tweaks to your vessel should do it.\\nI can handle the modifications.\\nMmm. Your science guy.\\nWell, I could use a copilot.\\nNo. No, I can\\'t.\\nI can\\'t leave Monica.\\nMom, it\\'s okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.\\nThere\\'s no way I\\'m going, baby.

Get off of there!\\nAt the end of this week, we will choose that man.\\nHe will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier.\\nRogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!\\nAnd they will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.\\nPick up the pace, ladies!\\nLet\\'s go, let\\'s go! Double time!\\nCome on! Faster! Faster!\\nMove! Move!\\nSquad, halt!\\nThat flag means we\\'re only at the halfway point.\\nFirst man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter.\\nMove, move!\\nCome on!

Come on, fall in!\\nLet\\'s go! Get back into formation!\\nRogers! I said fall in!\\nThank you, sir.\\nFaster, ladies! Come on.\\nMy grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul.\\nMove it!\\nYou\\'re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?\\nI\\'m more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.\\nWhen you brought a 90-pound asthmatic onto my army base,\\nI let it slide. I thought, \"What the hell.\"\\nMaybe he\\'d be useful to you, like a gerbil.\\nI never thought you\\'d pick him.\\nUp.\\nYou stick a needle in that kid\\'s arm, it\\'s gonna go right through him.\\n- Come on, girls. - Look at that.\\nHe\\'s making me cry.\\nI am looking for qualities beyond the physical.\\nDo you know how long it took to set up this project?\\nAll the groveling I had to do\\nin front of Senator What\\'s-His-Name\\'s committees?\\nBrandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.\\nThen throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him.\\nHe\\'s big, he\\'s fast. He obeys orders.\\n- He\\'s a soldier. - He is a bully.\\nYou don\\'t win wars with niceness, Doctor.\\nYou win wars with guts.\\nGrenade!\\nGet away!\\nGet back!\\nIt was a dummy grenade.\\nAll clear. Back in formation.\\nIs this a test?\\nHe\\'s still skinny.\\n- May I? - Yeah.\\nCan\\'t sleep?\\nI got the jitters, I guess.\\nMe, too.\\nCan I ask you a question?\\nJust one?\\nWhy me?\\nI suppose that is the only question that matters.\\nThis is from Augsburg. My city.\\nSo many people forget\\nthat the first country the Nazis invaded was their own.\\nYou know, after the last war, my people struggled.\\nThey felt weak. They felt small.\\nAnd then Hitler comes along with the marching\\nand the big show and the flags.\\nAnd he hears of me. My work. And he finds me.\\nAnd he says, \"You.\"\\nHe says, \"You will make us strong.\"\\nWell, I am not interested.\\nSo he sends the head of Hydra,\\nhis research division.\\nA brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt.\\nNow, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.\\nAnd he is ambitious.\\nHe and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth.\\nHitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.\\nBut for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.\\nFor him, it is real. He has become convinced\\nthat there is a great power hidden in the earth,\\nleft here by the gods,\\nwaiting to be seized by a superior man.\\nSo when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.\\nSchmidt must become that superior man.\\nDid it make him stronger?\\nYes.\\nBut there were other effects.\\nThe serum was not ready.\\nBut more important, the man.\\nThe serum amplifies everything that is inside,\\nso good becomes great.\\nBad becomes worse.\\nThis is why you were chosen.\\nBecause a strong man who has known power all his life\\nmay lose respect for that power,\\nbut a weak man knows the value of strength.\\nAnd knows\\ncompassion.\\nThanks. I think.\\nWhatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.\\nThat you will stay who you are.\\nNot a perfect soldier,\\nbut\\na good man.\\nTo the little guys.\\nNo, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?\\nNo, you have procedure tomorrow. No fluids.\\nAll right. We\\'ll drink it after.\\nNo, I don\\'t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? I drink it now.\\nIs there something in particular you need?\\nI understand you found him.\\nSee for yourself.\\nYou disapprove.\\nI just don\\'t see why you need concern yourself.\\nI can\\'t imagine he will succeed.\\nAgain.\\nHis serum is the Allies\\' only defense against this power we now possess.\\nIf we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.\\nShall I give the order?\\nIt has been given.\\nGood.\\nDr. Zola!\\nWhat do you think?\\nA masterpiece.\\nI know this neighborhood.\\nI got beat up in that alley.\\nAnd that parking lot.\\nAnd behind that diner.\\nDid you have something against running away?\\nYou start running, they\\'ll never let you stop.\\nYou stand up, you push back.\\nThey can\\'t say no forever, right?\\nI know a little of what that\\'s like, to have every door shut in your face.\\nI guess I just don\\'t know why you\\'d want to join the Army\\nif you were a beautiful dame.\\nOr a... A woman.\\nAn agent. Not a dame.\\nYou are beautiful, but...\\nYou have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?\\nI think this is the longest conversation I\\'ve had with one.\\nWomen aren\\'t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.\\nYou must have danced.\\nWell, asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying.\\nAnd the past few years, it just\\ndidn\\'t seem to matter that much. I figured I\\'d wait.\\nFor what?\\nThe right partner.\\nThis way.\\n- What are we doing here? - Follow me.\\nWonderful weather this morning, isn\\'t it?\\nYes, but I always carry an umbrella.\\nGood morning.\\nPlease, not now.\\nAre you ready?\\nGood. Take off your shirt, your tie, and your hat.\\nSenator Brandt, glad you could make it.\\nWhy exactly am I in Brooklyn?\\nWe needed access to the city\\'s power grid.\\nOf course, if you\\'d given me the generators I requisitioned...\\nA lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel.\\nThis is...\\nFred Clemson, State Department.\\nIf this project of yours comes through,\\nwe\\'d like to see it used for something other than headlines.\\nJesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.\\nComfortable?\\nIt\\'s a little big.\\nYou save me any of that schnapps?\\nNot as much as I should have. Sorry.\\nNext time.\\nMr. Stark, how are your levels?\\n- Levels at 100%. - Good.\\nWe may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,\\nbut we are ready as we\\'ll ever be.\\nAgent Carter?\\nDon\\'t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?\\n- Yes, of course. Sorry. - Good.\\nDo you hear me? Is this on?\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\ntoday we take not another step towards annihilation,\\nbut the first step\\non the path to peace.\\nWe begin with a series of microinjections into\\nthe subject\\'s major muscle groups. The serum infusion\\nwill cause immediate cellular change.\\nAnd then, to stimulate growth,\\nthe subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.\\nThat wasn\\'t so bad.\\nThat was penicillin.\\nSerum infusion beginning in\\nfive,\\nfour,\\nthree,\\ntwo,\\none.\\nNow, Mr. Stark.\\nSteven? Can you hear me?\\nIt\\'s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?\\nWe will proceed.\\nThat\\'s 10%.\\nTwenty percent.\\nThirty.\\nThat\\'s 40%.\\nVital signs are normal.\\nThat\\'s 50%.\\nSixty.\\nSeventy.\\nSteven!\\n- Steven! - Shut it down!\\nShut it down!\\nKill the reactor, Mr. Stark!\\nTurn it off!

Call it what it is. Exile.\\nI no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.\\nYou think this is about appearances?\\nYour Hydra division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.\\nAnd we had learned through local intelligence\\nyou had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.\\nThe Führer feels... How does he put it?\\n\"The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!\"\\nGentlemen,\\nyou have come to see the results of our work.\\nLet me show you.\\nHitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,\\nbut he cannot feed his armies for a month.\\nHis troops spill their blood across every field in Europe,\\nbut still he is no closer to achieving his goals.\\nAnd I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic?\\nScience. But I understand your confusion.\\nGreat power has always baffled primitive men.\\nHydra is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke,\\nwherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess,\\nall in a matter of hours.\\nYour enemies?\\nMy weapons contain enough destructive power\\nto decimate every hostile capital on Earth.\\nQuite simply, gentlemen,\\nI have harnessed the power of the gods.\\nThank you, Schmidt.\\nFor what?\\nFor making it clear how obviously mad you are.\\nBerlin is on this map!\\nSo it is.\\nYou will be punished for your insolence!\\nYou will be brought before the Führer himself!\\nSchmidt...\\nMy apologies, Doctor,\\nbut we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler\\'s shadow.\\nHail Hydra.\\nHail Hydra!\\nHail Hydra!\\nThink you got enough?\\nAny hope of reproducing the program is locked in your genetic code.\\nBut without Dr. Erskine, it would take years.\\nHe deserved more than this.\\nIf it could work only once, he\\'d be proud it was you.\\nColonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.\\nGreat.

But he has much bigger ambitions.\\nHydra is practically a cult.\\nThey worship Schmidt.

B-A-R... - I can spell.\\nI have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count.\\nBut the name does sound familiar.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nWhat about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?\\nYes, it\\'s called \"winning the war.\"\\nBut if you know where they are, why not at least...\\nThey\\'re 30 miles behind the lines\\nthrough some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe.\\nWe\\'d lose more men than we\\'d save.\\nBut I don\\'t expect you to understand that because you\\'re a chorus girl.\\nI think I understand just fine.\\nWell, then understand it somewhere else.\\nIf I read the posters correctly, you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.\\nYes, sir. I do.\\nIf you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.\\nWhat do you plan to do, walk to Austria?\\nIf that\\'s what it takes.\\nYou heard the Colonel. Your friend is most likely dead.\\nYou don\\'t know that.\\nEven so, he\\'s devising a strategy. If he detects...\\nBy the time he\\'s done that, it could be too late.\\nSteve!\\nYou told me you thought I was meant for more than this.

You know what you\\'re doing?\\nYeah. I\\'ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.\\nYou know how to use that thing?\\nOkay.\\nWhat is happening?\\nHey. Not exactly a Buick.\\n- That one. \"Zündung.\" - Zündung?\\nGet this thing going, Dugan!\\nI didn\\'t know you spoke German.\\nThree semesters at Howard, switched to French, girls much cuter.\\nDidn\\'t ask for the resume.\\n- On your left! - Up top!\\nNo, no! What are you doing?\\nOur forces are outmatched.\\nKeep moving! Grab those grenades!\\nSergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.\\nBucky?\\nOh, my God.\\n- Is that... - It\\'s me.\\n- It\\'s Steve. - Steve?\\n- Come on. - Steve.\\nI thought you were dead.\\nI thought you were smaller.\\nCome on.\\n- What happened to you? - I joined the Army.\\n- Did it hurt? - A little.\\nIs this permanent?\\nSo far.\\nCaptain America!\\nHow exciting!\\nI am a great fan of your films!\\nSo, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.\\nNot exactly an improvement,\\nbut still, impressive.\\nYou\\'ve got no idea.\\nHaven\\'t I?\\nNo matter what lies Erskine told you,\\nyou see, I was his greatest success!\\nYou don\\'t have one of those, do you?\\nYou are deluded, Captain.\\nYou pretend to be a simple soldier,\\nbut in reality, you are just afraid\\nto admit that we have left humanity behind.\\nUnlike you, I embrace it proudly.\\nWithout fear!\\nThen how come you\\'re running?\\nCome on, let\\'s go. Up.\\nSir? Are we going to the roof?\\nWhat about me?\\nWhere will I sit?\\nNot a scratch, Doctor.\\nNot a scratch.\\nLet\\'s go. One at a time.\\n- Gotta be a rope or something! - Just go! Get out of here!\\nNo! Not without you!\\nHell.\\nSenator Brandt, I regret to report that\\nCaptain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third.\\nAerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful.\\nAs a result, I must declare Captain Rogers\\nkilled in action. Period.\\nThe last surveillance flight is back.\\nNo sign of activity.\\n- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal. - Yes, sir.\\nI can\\'t touch Stark.\\nHe\\'s rich and he\\'s the Army\\'s number one weapons contractor.\\nYou are neither one.\\nWith respect, sir, I don\\'t regret my actions.\\nAnd I don\\'t think Captain Rogers did, either.\\nWhat makes you think I give a damn about your opinions?\\nI took a chance with you, Agent Carter.\\nAnd now America\\'s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead\\n\\'cause you had a crush.\\nIt wasn\\'t that. I had faith.\\nWell, I hope that\\'s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down.\\nWhat the hell\\'s going on out there?\\nLook who it is!\\nSome of these men need medical attention.\\n- Medic, we got wounded. - Right over here.\\nI\\'d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.\\nThat won\\'t be necessary.\\nYes, sir.\\nFaith, huh?\\nYou\\'re late.\\nCouldn\\'t call my ride.\\nHey!\\nLet\\'s hear it for Captain America!\\nI am honored to present this medal for valor\\nto my personal friend, Captain America!\\nCaptain America!\\nCaptain, that\\'s your cue!\\nI thought he\\'d be taller.\\nThe fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.\\nAnd the sixth one was\\nabout here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.\\nI just got a quick look.\\nWell, nobody\\'s perfect.\\nThese are the weapon factories we know about.\\nSergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped\\nall the parts to another facility that isn\\'t on this map.\\nAgent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.\\nI want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.\\nWhat about us?\\nWe are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt\\'s ass.\\nWhat do you say, Rogers? It\\'s your map.\\n- You think you can wipe Hydra off it? - Yes, sir. I\\'ll need a team.\\nWe\\'re already putting together the best men.\\nWith all due respect, sir, so am I.\\nSo, let\\'s get this straight.\\nWe barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?\\nPretty much.\\nSounds rather fun, actually.\\nI\\'m in.\\nWe\\'re in.\\nHell, I\\'ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.\\nWhat\\'s that?\\nOpen a tab.\\nWell, that was easy.\\n- Another round. - Where are they putting all this stuff?\\nSee? I told you.\\nThey\\'re all idiots.\\nHow about you?\\nYou ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?\\nHell, no.\\nThat little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight.\\nI\\'m following him.\\nBut you\\'re keeping the outfit, right?\\nYou know what?\\nIt\\'s kind of growing on me.\\n- Captain. - Agent Carter.\\nMa\\'am.\\nHoward has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?\\nSounds good.\\nI see your top squad is prepping for duty.\\nYou don\\'t like music?\\nI do, actually.\\nI might even, when this is all over, go dancing.\\nThen what are we waiting for?\\nThe right partner.\\n0800, Captain.\\nYes, ma\\'am. I\\'ll be there.\\nI\\'m invisible.\\nI\\'m turning into you. It\\'s like a horrible dream.\\nDon\\'t take it so hard. Maybe she\\'s got a friend.\\nEmission signature is unusual.\\nAlpha and beta ray neutral.\\nThough I doubt Rogers picked up on that.\\nSeems harmless enough.\\nHard to see what all the fuss is about.\\nWrite that down.\\nExcuse me. I\\'m looking for Mr. Stark.\\nHe\\'s in with Colonel Phillips.\\nOf course, you\\'re welcome to wait.\\nI read about what you did.\\nOh, the... Yeah.\\nWell, that\\'s, you know.\\nJust doing what needed to be done.\\nSounded like more than that. You saved nearly 400 men.\\nReally, it\\'s not a big deal.\\nTell that to their wives.\\nI don\\'t think they were all married.\\nYou\\'re a hero.\\nWell, that depends on the definition, really.\\nThe women of America, they owe you their thanks.\\nAnd seeing as they\\'re not here...\\nCaptain!\\nWe\\'re ready for you, if you\\'re not otherwise occupied.\\nAgent Carter, wait.\\nLooks like finding a partner wasn\\'t that hard after all.\\nPeggy, that\\'s not what you thought it was.\\nI don\\'t think anything, Captain, not one thing.\\nYou always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are, just like all the rest.\\nWell, what about you and Stark?\\nHow do I know you two haven\\'t been fondue-ing?\\nYou still don\\'t know a bloody thing about women.\\nFondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.\\n- Really? I didn\\'t think... - Nor should you, pal.\\nThe moment you think you know what\\'s going on in a woman\\'s head\\nis the moment your goose is well and truly cooked.\\nMe, I concentrate on work, which at the moment\\nis about making sure you and your men do not get killed.\\nCarbon polymer.\\nShould withstand your average German bayonet.\\nAlthough Hydra\\'s not going to attack you with a pocket knife.\\nI hear you\\'re kind of attached.\\nIt\\'s handier than you might think.\\nI took the liberty of coming up with some options.\\nThis one\\'s fun.\\nShe\\'s been fitted with electrical relays that allow you to...\\n- What about this one? - No, no, that\\'s just a prototype.\\n- What\\'s it made of? - Vibranium.\\nIt\\'s stronger than steel and a third the weight.\\nIt\\'s completely vibration absorbent.\\nHow come it\\'s not standard issue?\\nThat\\'s the rarest metal on Earth.\\nWhat you\\'re holding there, that\\'s all we\\'ve got.\\nYou quite finished, Mr. Stark?\\nI\\'m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.\\nWhat do you think?\\nYes, I think it works.\\nI had some ideas about the uniform.\\nWhatever you want, pal.\\nYou are failing!\\nWe are close to an offensive that will shake the planet,\\nyet we are continually delayed\\nbecause you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!\\nThis is hardly my area of expertise.\\nI merely developed the weapons. I cannot fire them.\\nFinish your mission, Doctor, before the American finishes his.\\nSir!\\nI\\'m sorry, Herr Schmidt.\\nWe fought to the last man.\\nEvidently not.\\nRemember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?\\nYeah, and I threw up?\\nThis isn\\'t payback, is it?\\nNow why would I do that?\\nWe were right. Dr. Zola\\'s on the train.\\nHydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.\\nWherever he\\'s going, they must need him bad.\\nLet\\'s get going, because they\\'re moving like the devil.\\nWe only got about a 10-second window.\\nYou miss that window, we\\'re bugs on a windshield.\\nMind the gap.\\nBetter get moving, bugs!\\nStop him! Fire again!\\n- I had him on the ropes. - I know you did.\\nGet down!\\nFire again!\\nKill him! Now!\\nBucky!\\nHang on!\\nGrab my hand!\\nSit down.\\n- What is this? - Steak.\\nWhat is in it?\\nCow.\\nDoctor, do you realize how difficult it is\\nto get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?\\nI don\\'t eat meat.\\nWhy not?\\nIt disagrees with me.\\nHow about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy, too?\\nEvery Hydra agent that we\\'ve tried to take alive\\nhas crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you.\\nSo, here is my brilliant theory.\\nYou want to live.\\nYou\\'re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.\\nI bought you dinner.\\n\"Given the valuable information he has provided\\n\"and in exchange for his full cooperation,\\n\"Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland\"?\\nI sent that message to Washington this morning, of course it was encoded.\\nYou guys haven\\'t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.\\nSchmidt will know this is a lie.\\nHe\\'s going to kill you anyway, Doc. You\\'re a liability.\\nYou know more about Schmidt than anyone.\\nAnd the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers\\' closest friend,\\nso I wouldn\\'t count on the very best of protection.\\nIt\\'s you or Schmidt.\\nIt\\'s just the hand you\\'ve been dealt.\\nSchmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods.\\nOnly the world itself will satisfy him.\\nYou do realize that\\'s nuts, don\\'t you?\\nWhat?\\nThe sanity of the plan is of no consequence.\\n- And why is that? - Because he can do it!\\nWhat\\'s his target?\\nHis target\\nis everywhere.\\nTomorrow,\\nHydra will stand master of the world,\\nborne to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.\\nOur enemies\\' weapons will be powerless against us.\\nIf they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them!\\nIf they cut off one head,\\ntwo more shall take its place.\\nHail Hydra.\\n- Hail Hydra! - Hail Hydra!\\n- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra! - Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!\\nBlackout is still in effect throughout the London area.\\nPlease wait for the all-clear.\\nYour attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice.\\nBlackout is still in effect throughout the London area.\\nDr. Erskine said that\\nthe serum wouldn\\'t just affect my muscles,\\nit would affect my cells.\\nCreate a protective system of regeneration and healing.\\nWhich means\\nI can\\'t get drunk.\\nDid you know that?\\nYour metabolism burns four times faster than the average person.\\nHe thought it could be one of the side effects.\\nIt wasn\\'t your fault.\\n- Did you read the report? - Yes.\\nThen you know that\\'s not true.\\nYou did everything you could.\\nDid you believe in your friend?\\nDid you respect him?\\nThen stop blaming yourself.\\nAllow Barnes the dignity of his choice.\\nHe damn well must have thought you were worth it.\\nI\\'m going after Schmidt.\\nI\\'m not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.\\nYou won\\'t be alone.\\nJohann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse. He thinks he\\'s a god,\\nand he\\'s willing to blow up half the world to prove it,\\nstarting with the USA.\\nSchmidt\\'s working with powers beyond our capabilities.\\nHe gets across the Atlantic,\\nhe will wipe out the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.\\nHow much time we got?\\nAccording to my new best friend, under 24 hours.\\n- Where is he now? - Hydra\\'s last base is here.\\nIn the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.\\nSo what are we supposed to do?\\nI mean, it\\'s not like we can just knock on the front door.\\nWhy not?\\nThat\\'s exactly what we\\'re going to do.\\nArrogance may not be a uniquely American trait,\\nbut I must say, you do it better than anyone.\\nBut there are limits\\nto what even you can do, Captain.\\nOr did Erskine tell you otherwise?\\nHe told me you were insane.\\nHe resented my genius\\nand tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.\\nBut he gave you everything.\\nSo,\\nwhat made you so special?\\nNothing.\\nI\\'m just a kid from Brooklyn.\\nI can do this all day.\\nOf course you can, of course.\\nBut, unfortunately, I am on a tight schedule.\\nSo am I.\\nRogers! You might need this!\\nThanks!\\nWe\\'re in! Assault team, go!\\nMove out!\\nMove!\\nKeep your spacing!\\nCut off one head, two more shall...\\nLet\\'s go find two more!\\nYou\\'re late.\\n- Weren\\'t you about to... - Right.\\nGet in!\\n- Keep it steady! - Wait!\\nGo get him.\\nI\\'m not kissing you!\\n- You don\\'t give up, do you? - Nope!\\nYou could have the power of the gods!\\nYet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations!\\nI have seen the future, Captain!\\n- There are no flags! - Not my future!\\nWhat have you done?\\nNo!\\nCome in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?\\nCaptain Rogers, what is your...\\nSteve, is that you? Are you all right?\\nPeggy, Schmidt\\'s dead!\\nWhat about the plane?\\nThat\\'s a little bit tougher to explain.\\nGive me your coordinates. I\\'ll find you a safe landing site.\\nThere\\'s not gonna be a safe landing.\\nBut I can try and force it down.\\nI\\'ll get Howard on the line. He\\'ll know what to do.\\nThere\\'s not enough time.\\nThis thing\\'s moving too fast and it\\'s heading for New York.\\nI got to put her in the water.\\nPlease, don\\'t do this. We have time. We can work it out.\\nRight now I\\'m in the middle of nowhere.\\nIf I wait any longer, a lot of people are gonna die.\\nPeggy,\\nthis is my choice.\\nPeggy?\\nI\\'m here.\\nI\\'m gonna need a rain check on that dance.\\nAll right.\\nA week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.\\nYou got it.\\n8:00 on the dot.

Welcome.\\nWe are coming to you live from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,\\nwhere Tony Stark has just walked offstage.\\nDon\\'t worry if you can\\'t make it down here tonight\\nbecause this Expo goes on all year long.\\nAnd I\\'m gonna be here checking out all the attractions\\nand the pavilions and the inventions from all around the world.\\nMake sure you join me...\\nAll right, it\\'s a zoo out there, watch out.\\n- Open up, let\\'s go. - Hey! Nice to see you.\\n- All right. Thank you. I remember you. - Tony, Tony...\\nHey, hey...\\n- Call me. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.\\nHello. It would be a pleasure.\\n- Okay. - See you, buddy.\\nThis is Larry.\\nHey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure.\\n- Nice to see you. - Call me. Call me.\\n- Larry King. - Larry!\\nYes, my people, my people.\\nCome on, Tony. There we go.\\n- Very mellow. - That wasn\\'t so bad.\\nNo, it was perfect.\\nLook what we got here, the new model.\\n- Hey, does she come with the car? - I certainly hope so.\\n- Hi. - Hi.\\n- And you are? - Marshal.\\n- Irish. I like it. - Pleased to meet you, Tony.\\nI\\'m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?\\n- Bedford. - What are you doing here?\\n- Looking for you. - Yeah? You found me.\\n- What are you up to later? - Serving subpoenas.\\nHe doesn\\'t like to be handed things.\\n- Yeah, I have a peeve. - I got it.\\nYou are hereby ordered\\nto appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee\\ntomorrow morning at 9: 00 A.M.\\n- Can I see a badge? - You wanna see the badge?\\nHe likes the badge.\\n- You still like it? - Yep.\\n- How far are we from D.C.? - D.C.? 250 miles.\\nMr. Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr. Stark. Please.\\n- Yes, dear? - Can I have your attention?\\nAbsolutely.\\nDo you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?\\n- I do not. I do not. - You do not?\\nWell, it depends on how you define the word \"weapon.\"\\n- The Iron Man weapon. - My device does not fit that description.\\nWell... How would you describe it?\\nI would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.\\n- As? - It\\'s a high-tech prosthesis.\\nThat is... That is...\\nThat\\'s actually the most apt description I can make of it.\\nIt\\'s a weapon. It\\'s a weapon, Mr. Stark.\\nPlease, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen...\\nMy priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people\\n- of the United States of America. - Well, you can forget it.\\nI am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.\\nTo turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself,\\nwhich is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution,\\ndepending on what state you\\'re in.\\n- You can\\'t have it. - Look, I\\'m no expert...\\nIn prostitution? Of course not. You\\'re a senator. Come on.\\nI\\'m no expert in weapons.\\nWe have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.\\nI\\'d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.\\nLet the record reflect that I observed Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,\\nand I am wondering\\nif and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.\\nAbsolutely. I\\'m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony.\\nYou\\'re the wonder boy.\\nSenator, if I may.\\nI may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert?\\nYour dad. Howard Stark.\\nReally a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age.\\nLet\\'s just be clear. He was no flower child.\\nHe was a lion.\\nWe all know why we\\'re here. In the last six months,\\nAnthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.\\nAnd yet he insists it\\'s a shield.\\nHe asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.\\nI wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do.\\nI\\'d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house,\\nbut this ain\\'t Canada.\\nYou know, we live in a world of grave threats,\\nthreats that Mr. Stark will not always be able to foresee.\\nThank you.\\nGod bless Iron Man. God bless America.\\nThat is well said, Mr. Hammer.\\nThe committee would now like to invite.\\nLieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.\\nRhodey? What?\\nHey, buddy. I didn\\'t expect to see you here.\\nLook, it\\'s me, I\\'m here. Deal with it. Let\\'s move on.\\nI just...\\n- Drop it. - All right, I\\'ll drop it.\\nI have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon,\\ncompiled by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record,\\ncan you please read page 57, paragraph four?\\nYou\\'re requesting that I read specific selections\\n- from my report, Senator? - Yes, sir.\\nIt was my understanding that I was going to be testifying\\nin a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.\\nI understand. A lot of things have changed today.\\n- So if you could just read... - You do understand\\nthat reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect\\n- the summary of my final... - Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.\\nVery well.\\n\"As he does not operate within any definable branch of government,.\"\\n\"Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation\"\\n\"and to her interests.\"\\nI did, however, go on to summarise\\nthat the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities.\\n- And that it would be in our interest... - That\\'s enough, Colonel.\\nTo fold Mr. Stark... - That\\'s enough.\\nInto the existing chain of command, Senator.\\nI\\'m not a joiner, but I\\'ll consider Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.\\nWe can amend the hours a little bit.\\nI\\'d like to go on and show, if I may,\\nthe imagery that\\'s connected to your report.\\nI believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images\\n- to the general public at this time. - With all due respect,\\nColonel, I understand.\\nAnd if you could just narrate those for us, we\\'d be very grateful.\\nLet\\'s have the images.\\nIntelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos\\nare, in fact, attempts at making manned copies\\nof Mr. Stark\\'s suit.\\nThis has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground,\\nindicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.\\nHold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.\\nBoy, I\\'m good. I commandeered your screens.\\nI need them. Time for a little transparency.\\n- Now, let\\'s see what\\'s really going on. - What is he doing?\\nIf you will direct your attention to said screens...\\nI believe that\\'s North Korea.\\nCan you turn that off? Take it off.\\nIran.\\nNo grave immediate threat here. Is that Justin Hammer?\\nHow did Hammer get in the game?\\nJustin, you\\'re on TV. Focus up.\\nOkay, give me a left twist. Left\\'s good. Turn to the right.\\nOh, shit. Oh, shit!\\nWow.\\nYeah, I\\'d say most countries, five, 10 years away.\\nHammer Industries, 20.\\nI\\'d like to point out that that test pilot survived.\\nI think we\\'re done, is the point that he\\'s making.\\n- I don\\'t think there\\'s any reason... - The point is, you\\'re welcome, I guess.\\n- For what? - Because I\\'m your nuclear deterrent.\\nIt\\'s working. We\\'re safe. America is secure.\\nYou want my property? You can\\'t have it.\\nBut I did you a big favour.\\nI\\'ve successfully privatized world peace.\\nWhat more do you want? For now!\\nI tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.\\nYou, Mr. Stark... you, buddy.\\nWe\\'re adjourned. We\\'re adjourned for today.\\n- Okay. - You\\'ve been a delight.\\nMy bond is with the people.\\nAnd I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself.\\nIf there\\'s one thing I\\'ve proven\\nit\\'s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.\\nWake up. Daddy\\'s home.\\nWelcome home, sir.\\nCongratulations on the opening ceremonies.\\nThey were such a success, as was your Senate hearing.\\nAnd may I say how refreshing it is\\nto finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.\\nYou!\\nI swear to God I\\'ll dismantle you. I\\'ll soak your motherboard.\\nI\\'ll turn you into a wine rack.\\nHow many ounces a day of this gobbledegook\\nam I supposed to drink?\\nWe are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.\\nCheck palladium levels.\\nBlood toxicity, 24%.\\nIt appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit\\nis accelerating your condition.\\nAnother core has been depleted.\\nGod, they\\'re running out quick.\\nI have run simulations on every known element,\\nand none can serve as a viable replacement\\nfor the palladium core.\\nYou are running out of both time and options.\\nUnfortunately, the device that\\'s keeping you alive\\nis also killing you.\\nMiss Potts is approaching.\\n- I recommend that you inform her... - Mute.\\nIs this a joke?\\n- What are you thinking? - What?\\n- What are you thinking? - Hey, I\\'m thinking I\\'m busy.\\nAnd you\\'re angry about something.\\nDo you have the sniffles? I don\\'t wanna get sick.\\n- Did you just donate... - Keep your business.\\nOur entire modern art collection to the...\\n- Boy Scouts of America. ...Boy Scouts of America?\\nYes. It is a worthwhile organisation.\\nI didn\\'t physically check the crates but, basically, yes.\\nAnd it\\'s not \"our\" collection, it\\'s my collection. No of fence.\\nNo, you know what? I think I\\'m actually entitled\\nto say \"our\" collection\\nconsidering the time that I put in, over 10 years,\\n- curating that. - It was a tax write-off. I needed that.\\nYou know, there\\'s only about 8,011things\\nthat I really need to talk to you about.\\nDummy. Hey, stop spacing out.\\nThe Bridgeport\\'s already machining that part.\\nThe Expo is a gigantic waste of time.\\nI need you to wear a surgical mask until you\\'re feeling better.\\n- Is that okay? - That\\'s rude.\\nThere\\'s nothing more important to me than the Expo.\\nIt\\'s my primary point of concern.\\n- I don\\'t know why you\\'re... - The Expo is your ego gone crazy.\\nWow. Look at that.\\nThat\\'s modern art. That\\'s going up.\\n- You\\'ve got to be kidding. - I\\'m gonna put this up right now.\\n- This is vital. - Stark is in complete disarray.\\n- You understand that? - No. Our stocks have never been higher.\\n- Yes, from a managerial standpoint. - You are... Well, if it\\'s messy,\\n- then let\\'s double back. - Let me give you an example.\\n- Let\\'s move on to another subject. - No, no, no, no.\\nYou are not taking down the Barnett Newman\\n- and hanging that up! - I\\'m not taking it down.\\nI\\'m just replacing it with this.\\n- Let\\'s see what I can get going here. - Okay, fine.\\nMy point is, we have already awarded contracts\\n- to the wind farm people. - Yeah. Don\\'t say \"wind farm.\"\\n- I\\'m already feeling gassy. - And to the plastic plantation tree,\\nwhich was your idea, by the way. Those people are on payroll...\\n- Everything was my idea... and you won\\'t make a decision.\\nI don\\'t care about the liberal agenda any more.\\nIt\\'s boring. Boring. I\\'m giving you a boring alert.\\n- You do it. - I do what?\\nExcellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.\\n- Yeah, I\\'m trying to run the company. - Pepper, I need you to run the company.\\n- Well, stop trying to do it and do it. - You will not\\n- give me the information... - I\\'m not asking you to try...\\nin order to... - I\\'m asking you\\nto physically do it. I need you to do it.\\n- I am trying to do it. - Pepper, you\\'re not listening to me!\\n- No, you are not listening to me. - I\\'m trying to make you CEO.\\nWhy won\\'t you let me?\\n- Have you been drinking? - Chlorophyll.\\nI hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,\\neffective immediately.\\nYeah, done deal. Okay?\\nI\\'ve actually given this a fair amount of thought,\\nbelieve it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,\\ntrying to figure out who a worthy successor would be.\\nAnd then I realised\\nit\\'s you. It\\'s always been you.\\nI thought there\\'d be a legal issue,\\nbut actually I\\'m capable of appointing my successor.\\nMy successor being you.\\nCongratulations?\\n- Take it, just take it. - I don\\'t know what to think.\\nDon\\'t think. Drink.\\nThere you go.\\nThe notary\\'s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?\\nI\\'m on happy time.\\n- Sorry. - What the hell was that?\\nIt\\'s called mixed martial arts. It\\'s been around for three weeks.\\nIt\\'s called dirty boxing. There\\'s nothing new about it.\\nAll right, put them up. Come on.\\nI promise you this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.\\nI need you to initial each box.\\nLesson one. Never take your eye off...\\nThat\\'s it. I\\'m done.\\n- What\\'s your name, lady? - Rushman. Natalie Rushman.\\nFront and center. Come into the church.\\n- No. You\\'re seriously not gonna ask... - If it pleases the court, which it does.\\n- It\\'s no problem. - I\\'m sorry. He\\'s very eccentric.\\nWhat?\\n- Can you give her a lesson? - No problem.\\n- Pepper. - What?\\n- Who is she? - She is from legal.\\nAnd she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit\\n- if you keep ogling her like that. - I need a new assistant, boss.\\nYes, and I\\'ve got three excellent potential candidates.\\nThey\\'re lined up and ready to meet you.\\nI don\\'t have time to meet. I need someone now.\\nI feel like it\\'s her.\\nNo, it\\'s not.\\n- You ever boxed before? - I have, yes.\\nWhat, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?\\n- How do I spell your name, Natalie? - R-U-S-H-M-A-N.\\n- What, are you gonna Google her now? - I thought I was ogling her.\\n- Wow. Very, very impressive individual. - You\\'re so predictable, you know that?\\nShe\\'s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin.\\n- Who speaks Latin? - No one speaks Latin.\\n- No one speaks Latin? - It\\'s a dead language.\\nYou can read Latin or you can write Latin,\\n- but you can\\'t speak Latin... - Did you model in Tokyo?\\n- \\'Cause she modeled in Tokyo. - Well...\\nI need her. She\\'s got everything that I need.\\nRule number one, never take your eye off your opponent.\\nOh, my God!\\n- Happy! - That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.\\n- I just slipped. - You did?\\n- Yeah. - Looks like a TKO to me.\\nJust... I need your impression.\\nYou have a quiet reserve. I don\\'t know, you have an old soul.\\n- I meant your fingerprint. - Right.\\n- So, how are we doing? - Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.\\n- You\\'re the boss. - Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\\n- No. - Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.\\nThank you very much.\\n- I want one. - No.\\nYou know, it\\'s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,\\n- just go with it. - Go with it? Go with what?\\n- Mr. Stark? - Hey.\\nHello. How was your flight?\\nIt was excellent. Boy, it\\'s nice to see you.\\nWe have one photographer from the ACM, if you don\\'t mind. Okay?\\n- When did this happen? - What? You made me do it.\\n- I made you do what? - You quit. Smile. Look right there.\\nStop acting constipated.\\n- Don\\'t flare your nostrils. - You are so predictable.\\n- That\\'s the amazing thing. - Right this way.\\n- You look fantastic. - Why, thank you very much.\\nBut that\\'s unprofessional. What\\'s on the docket?\\nYou have a 9: 30 dinner.\\n- Perfect. I\\'ll be there at 11: 00. - Absolutely.\\n- Is this us? - It can be.\\n- Great. Make it us. - Okay.\\n- Mr. Musk. How are you? - Hi, Pepper.\\n- Congratulations on the promotion. - Thank you very much.\\nElon, how\\'s it going? Those Merlin engines are fantastic.\\nThank you. Yeah, I\\'ve got an idea for an electric jet.\\n- You do? - Yeah.\\nThen we\\'ll make it work.\\n- You want a massage? - Oh, God. No,\\n- I don\\'t want a massage. - I\\'ll have Natalie make an...\\n- I don\\'t want Natalie to do... - Don\\'t want you tense.\\nBy the way, I didn\\'t mean to spring this on you.\\nThank you very much.\\n- Green is not your best colour. - Oh, please.\\nAnthony! Is that you?\\n- My least favourite person on Earth. - Hey, pal.\\n- Justin Hammer. - How you doing?\\nYou\\'re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.\\nYou know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair.\\n- You guys know each other? - Hi.\\n- Yes. - Yes.\\n- Yes, roughly. - We do.\\nBTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.\\n- I know. I know. - Congratulations.\\nMy editor will kill me if I don\\'t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.\\n- Can I? - Sure.\\nShe\\'s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair.\\nI thought I\\'d throw her a bone, you know.\\n- Right. - Right?\\nWell, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.\\nAnd she wrote a story as well.\\n- It was very impressive. - That was good.\\n- Very well done. - Thank you.\\n- I\\'m gonna go wash. - Don\\'t leave me.\\n- Hey, buddy. How you doing? - I\\'m all right.\\n- Looking gorgeous. - Please, this is tough.\\nCan I ask you... Is this the first time...\\nFromage.\\n- Say, \"Brie.\" ...that you guys have seen each other?\\nGod, that\\'s so awful.\\nListen, is it the first time you\\'ve seen each other since the Senate?\\nSince he got his contract revoked...\\n- Actually, it\\'s on hold... when you were attempting to...\\nThat\\'s not what I heard. What\\'s the difference between \"hold\"\\n- and \"cancelled\"? The truth? - Yes, what is?\\nNo. The truth is... Why don\\'t we put that away?\\nThe truth is, I\\'m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.\\nWell, if you invent something that works,\\nI\\'ll make sure I get you a slot.\\n- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready. - Yes?\\nI actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.\\n- Hammer needs a slot, Christine. - We kid, yeah.\\nWe kid. We\\'re kidders.\\nGot any other bad ideas?\\nTony!\\nTony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We\\'re not competitors.\\nHim being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities\\nfor Hammer Industries, you know?\\n- Everything that Tony and I do... - Well, what\\'s the use of having...\\nis a healthy... and owning a race car...\\ncompetition... if you don\\'t drive it?\\nIs he driving?\\nNatalie. Natalie!\\n- Yes, Miss Potts? - Did you know about this?\\nThis is the first that I have known of it.\\nThis... This cannot happen.\\nAbsolutely. I understand. How can I help you?\\n- Where\\'s Happy? - He\\'s waiting outside.\\n- Okay, get him. I need Happy. - Right away.\\nTony\\'s... You know, he...\\nWe\\'re not competitive. You know what I mean?\\nYeah, yeah, yeah. You know,\\n- can you excuse me just one second? - Just read me what you wrote.\\n- I will. I will, after. - Just read it back to me.\\nBut I have to make one quick phone call.\\n- Where are you going? - This is great.\\n- I\\'ve got some caviar coming. - This is great stuff.\\n- I\\'ll be right back. - Look!\\nThat\\'s Stark.\\nGo, go!\\nHang on.\\n- Give me the case. - Here. Take it.\\n- Where\\'s the key? - It\\'s in my pocket.\\nCar!\\nOh, my God!\\n- Are you okay? - Yeah.\\n- Were you heading for me or him? - I was trying to scare him.\\n- \\'Cause I can\\'t tell! - Are you out of your mind?\\n- Better security. - Get in the car right now!\\nI was attacked! We need better security.\\n- Get in the car! - You\\'re CEO. Better security measures.\\nGod, it\\'s embarrassing.\\nFirst vacation in two years.\\nOh, my God!\\n- I got him! - Hit him again. Hit him again.\\nFootball.\\n- I got him! - Take the case! Take it!\\n- Take the case! - Give him the case!\\nStop banging the car!\\nCalm down.\\nGod! God!\\nGive me the case! Please! Come on!\\nYou... You lose.\\nYou lose. You lose, Stark.\\nPretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low.\\nYou could have doubled up your rotations.\\nYou focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels.\\nIt\\'s effective. Not very efficient.\\nBut it\\'s a passable knock-off.\\nI don\\'t get it. A little fine tuning,\\nyou could have made a solid paycheck.\\nYou could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran,\\nor gone right to the black market.\\nYou look like you got friends in low places.\\nYou come from a family of thieves and butchers.\\nAnd now, like all guilty men,\\nyou try to rewrite your own history.\\nAnd you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.\\nSpeaking of thieves, where did you get this design?\\nMy father. Anton Vanko.\\nWell, I never heard of him.\\nMy father is the reason you\\'re alive.\\nThe reason I\\'m alive is \\'cause you had a shot, you took it,\\nyou missed.\\nDid I?\\nIf you can make God bleed,\\nthe people will cease to believe in him.\\nAnd there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come.\\nThe truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch\\nas the world will consume you.\\nWhere will you be watching the world consume me from?\\nThat\\'s right. A prison cell. I\\'ll send you a bar of soap.\\nHey, Tony. Before you go,\\npalladium in the chest, painful way to die.\\nIt\\'s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle\\nand this man has no idea what he\\'s doing.\\nHe thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.\\nI was at a hearing where Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant\\nthat these suits can\\'t exist anywhere else,\\ndon\\'t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else,\\nat least for five to 10 years,\\nand here we are in Monaco realising, \"These suits exist now.\"\\nMute.\\nHe should be giving me a medal. That\\'s the truth.\\n- What is that? - This is your in-flight meal.\\nDid you just make that?\\nYeah. Where do you think I\\'ve been for three hours?\\nTony,\\nwhat are you not telling me?\\nI don\\'t want to go home. At all.\\nLet\\'s cancel my birthday party and...\\nWe\\'re in Europe. Let\\'s go to Venice, Cipriani.\\n- Remember? - Oh, yes.\\nIt\\'s a great place to\\n- be healthy. - I don\\'t think this is the right time.\\nWe\\'re in kind of a mess.\\nYeah, but maybe that\\'s why it\\'s the best time.\\n- \\'Cause then we... - Well, I think as the CEO,\\nI need to show up.\\nAs CEO, you are entitled to a leave.\\n- A leave? - A company retreat.\\n- A retreat? During a time like this? - Just a ride.\\nWell, I\\'m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.\\nNot everybody runs on batteries, Tony.\\nHey, there he is.\\nThere he is.\\nWhat an absolute pleasure. Welcome.\\nOh, goodness gracious.\\nCan we get the handcuffs off my friend here?\\nForgive me, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m such a huge fan of yours.\\nI didn\\'t want to make a first impression like this.\\nHe\\'s not an animal. Come on.\\nHe\\'s a human being. Thank you.\\nWe\\'re fine.\\nMy name is Justin Hammer.\\nI\\'d like to do some business with you. Please sit.\\nDig in. What do we have today, Jack?\\n- We have some salmon carpaccio. - Salmon carpaccio.\\nAnything you want here, we got it.\\nI like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco.\\nIt\\'s Italian, though.\\nOrganic ice cream.\\nI got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.\\nWhat I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track,\\nhow you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody,\\nthat was... Wow!\\nYou spoke to me with what you did.\\nAnd I know that you knew that I\\'d be listening.\\nThis is why I couldn\\'t bear to have you shipped off\\nto God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent.\\nBut if I might make a suggestion,\\nyou know, you don\\'t just go and try and kill the guy.\\nI think, if I may, you go after his legacy.\\nThat\\'s what you kill.\\nYou and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.\\nThe only difference between you and I is that I have resources.\\nI think, if I may,\\nyou need my resources.\\nSomeone behind you, a benefactor.\\nI\\'d like to be that guy.\\nOkay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator.\\nI don\\'t know. Have you been understanding everything I\\'m saying?\\nVery good, man.\\n- Very good, man. - Very good, man.\\nHey!\\n- Hey. - Yes?\\nI want my bird.\\n- A bird? You want a bird? - I want my bird.\\nI can get you a bird. I can get you 10 birds.\\nI want my bird.\\nWell, okay. Nothing\\'s impossible. I could...\\nAre we talking about... Is this a bird back in Russia?\\nYes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong\\n- despite the events in Monaco. - Yes, of course.\\n- The AP wants a quote. - Don\\'t tell him. Fax them...\\nWhere is he?\\n- He doesn\\'t want to be disturbed. - He\\'s downstairs.\\nWhat happened in Monaco? - Yes, but...\\nBut his continuing erratic behaviour\\nmay lead many people to ask themselves,\\n\"Can this man still protect us?\"\\nIron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.\\nQuery complete, sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist\\nwho defected to the United States in 1963.\\nHowever, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967.\\nHis son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,\\nwas convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,\\nand served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.\\nNo further records exist.\\nTony, you gotta get upstairs\\nand get on top of this situation right now.\\nListen. I\\'ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day,\\ntrying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH,\\nknocking down your front door and taking these.\\nThey\\'re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?\\nThey\\'re sick of the games.\\nYou said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years.\\nWell, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday.\\nIt\\'s not theoretical any more.\\nAre you listening to me?\\n- Are you okay? - Let\\'s go.\\nHey, man. Hey, hey!\\n- You all right? - Yeah, I should get to my desk.\\n- See that cigar box? - Yeah.\\nIt\\'s palladium.\\nIs that supposed to be smoking?\\nIf you must know, it\\'s neutron damage. It\\'s from the reactor wall.\\nYou had this in your body?\\nAnd how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?\\nRoad rash.\\nThank you.\\n- What are you looking at? - I\\'m looking at you.\\nYou wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act\\nand it\\'s unnecessary. You don\\'t have to do this alone.\\nYou know, I wish I could believe that. I really do.\\nBut you\\'ve gotta trust me.\\nContrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I\\'m doing.\\nThis is where we do it. This is my humble abode.\\nYou can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right?\\nNo pressure.\\nHere they are. I\\'m very excited. They\\'re combat-ready.\\nI may have done a few miscalculations\\nand rushed the prototype into production.\\nSue me, I\\'m enthusiastic.\\nGo ahead, take a look around.\\nYou don\\'t wanna do that.\\nYou\\'ll be able to access that\\nas soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes.\\nCan we generate some encrypted pass codes?\\nGet some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack.\\nNever mind, I...\\nWow. Okay. Good stuff.\\n- Sorry? - Software shit.\\nWell...\\nYou\\'re good.\\nYou really blasted in past the firewall there.\\nLet me show you where you\\'re gonna be working primarily.\\nGo ahead, take a look.\\nGet a good look at that. That\\'s something, isn\\'t it?\\nYou know, those are really just for show and tell.\\nThey\\'re $125.7 million a pop, so... Wait! Oh, gosh.\\nJesus Christ. Get somebody up here.\\nThat\\'s where the pilot goes.\\nI\\'m having a tough time finding volunteers.\\nI\\'ll take care of that, just leave it.\\nWhat you want them do?\\nWell, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.\\nI want to make Iron Man look like an antique.\\nI wanna go to that Stark Expo,\\nI wanna take a dump in Tony\\'s front yard.\\nYou know what I\\'m talking about?\\n- I can do that.

I had a feeling.\\nDo you know which watch you\\'d like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?\\nI\\'ll give them a look.\\nI should cancel the party.\\n- Probably. - Yeah.\\n- \\'Cause it\\'s... - Ill-timed.\\nRight, sends the wrong message.\\nInappropriate.\\nIs that dirty enough for you?\\nGold face, brown band. The Jaeger. I\\'ll give that a look.\\nBring them over here.\\nI\\'ll take that. Why don\\'t you...\\nI gotta say it. It\\'s hard to get a read on you.\\n- Where are you from? - Legal.\\nCan I ask you a question, hypothetically?\\nBit odd.\\nIf this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have,\\nhow would you celebrate it?\\nI\\'d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.\\n- Good evening. - Good evening.\\nYes, sir, I understand.\\nNo. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I\\'ll handle it.\\nSir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours,\\nIron Man will be back on watch.\\nHey, Pepper.\\nI\\'m going to go get some air.\\nWhat\\'s wrong?\\n- I don\\'t know what to do. - You gotta be kidding me.\\n- That\\'s it. I\\'m making... Pepper. - No, no, no. Don\\'t call anyone.\\nThis is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.\\nI know. I know. I get it.\\nI\\'m gonna handle it, okay? Just let me handle it.\\nHandle it. Or I\\'m gonna have to.\\nYou know, the question I get asked most often is,\\n\"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?\"\\nJust like that.\\nDoes this guy know how to throw a party or what?\\nI love you.\\nUnbelievable! Thank you so much.\\nTony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night.\\nAnd we\\'re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.\\nNo, no, no, we can\\'t... Wait, wait, wait.\\nWe didn\\'t have the cake. We didn\\'t blow out the candles.\\nYou\\'re out of control, okay? Trust me on this one, okay?\\n- You\\'re out of control, gorgeous. - It\\'s time to go to bed. It\\'s time.\\n- Give me another smooch. - You\\'re not going to be\\n- happy about this. - Come on, you know you want to.\\nYou just peed the suit.\\n- I know. It has a filtration system. - It\\'s not sexy.\\nYou could drink that water.\\nJust send everybody home, okay? It\\'s time to...\\n- If you say so. - Okay.\\nI\\'ll take this, you take that.\\nPepper Potts.\\nShe\\'s right. The party\\'s over.\\nThen again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago.\\nThe after-party starts in 15 minutes.\\nAnd if anybody, Pepper, doesn\\'t like it, there\\'s the door.\\nYeah!\\nHit!\\nPull!\\nI think she wants the Gallagher!\\nI\\'m only gonna say this once.\\nGet out.\\nYou don\\'t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!\\nGoldstein.\\nYes, Mr. Stark?\\nGive me a phat beat to beat my buddy\\'s ass to.\\nI told you to shut it down.\\nNow, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.\\nReally?\\nSorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn\\'t have a sidekick.\\nSidekick this!\\nHad enough?\\n- Natalie! - Miss Potts.\\nDon\\'t you \"Miss Potts\" me! I\\'m on to you.\\nYou know what? Ever since you came here...\\nPepper!\\nGet out of here. Get out of here.\\nYou want it? Take it!\\nPut your hand down.\\nYou think you got what it takes to wear that suit?\\nWe don\\'t have to do this, Tony.\\nYou wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.\\n- Put it down! - You gonna take a shot?\\n- Put it down! - No!\\n- Drop it, Tony! - Take it.\\nEdwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,\\ninbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet...\\nColonel.\\nMajor.\\nWow.\\nYeah.\\nLet\\'s take it inside.\\nClear the area.\\nSir!\\nI\\'m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.\\nI told you I don\\'t wanna join your super-secret boy band.\\nNo, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself.\\n- How\\'s that working out for you? - It\\'s... It\\'s... It\\'s...\\nI\\'m sorry. I don\\'t wanna get off on the wrong foot.\\nDo I look at the patch or the eye?\\nHonestly, I\\'m a bit hung over.\\nI\\'m not sure if you\\'re real or if I\\'m having...\\nI am very real.\\nI\\'m the realest person you\\'re ever gonna meet.\\n- Just my luck. Where\\'s the staff here? - That\\'s not looking so good.\\nI\\'ve been worse.\\nWe\\'ve secured the perimeter,\\nbut I don\\'t think we should hold it for too much longer.\\n- You\\'re fired. - That\\'s not up to you.\\nTony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.\\n- Hi. - I\\'m a S.H.I.E.I.D. shadow.\\nOnce we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.\\nI suggest you apologise.\\nYou\\'ve been very busy.\\nYou made your girl your CEO, you\\'re giving away all your stuff.\\nYou let your friend fly away with your suit.\\nNow, if I didn\\'t know better...\\nYou don\\'t know better. I didn\\'t give it to him. He took it.\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?\\nYou\\'re Iron Man and he just took it?\\nThe little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?\\nIs that possible?\\nWell, according to Mr. Stark\\'s database security guidelines,\\nthere are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.\\n- What do you want from me? - What do we want from you?\\nWhat do you want from me?\\nYou have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.\\nContrary to your belief, you are not the center of my universe.\\nI have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.\\nHit him.\\nOh, God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?\\nCould you please not do anything awful for five seconds?\\n- What did she just do to me? - What did we just do for you?\\nThat\\'s lithium dioxide. It\\'s gonna take the edge off.\\nWe\\'re trying to get you back to work.\\nGive me a couple of boxes of that. I\\'ll be right as rain.\\nIt\\'s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.\\nDoesn\\'t look like it\\'s gonna be an easy fix.\\nTrust me, I know. I\\'m good at this stuff.\\nI\\'ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium.\\nI\\'ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.\\nWell, I\\'m here to tell you, you haven\\'t tried them all.\\nHey, hey, hey. Special delivery.\\nCandygram.\\nI brought you something.\\nOh, yeah.\\nWe got you the bird, pal.\\nThis is not my bird.\\nWhat do you mean? That\\'s the bird. This is the bird.\\nYeah.

Drone better?\\nWhy is drone better? Why is drone better?\\nPeople make problem.\\nTrust me. Drone better.\\nIvan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird.\\nYou said, \"No problem.\"\\nThat\\'s what you said to me. You said, \"No problem.\"\\nNow I need suits. The government wants suits.\\nLike Iron Man.

You\\'ve made your country proud.\\nThank you, sir.\\nThat thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.\\nNo, it was finished.\\nIt has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my...\\nNo. Howard said the arc reactor\\nwas the stepping stone to something greater.\\nHe was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race.\\nHe was on to something big,\\nsomething so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor\\nlook like a triple-A battery.\\nJust him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?\\nAnton Vanko is the other side of that coin.\\nAnton saw it as a way to get rich.\\nWhen your father found out, he had him deported.\\nWhen the Russians found out he couldn\\'t deliver,\\nthey shipped his ass off to Siberia\\nand he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.\\nNot quite the environment you want to raise a kid in,\\nthe son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.\\nYou told me I hadn\\'t tried everything.\\nWhat do you mean I haven\\'t tried everything?\\nWhat haven\\'t I tried?\\nHe said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge\\nto finish what he started.\\nHe said that?\\nAre you that guy? Are you?\\n\\'Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.\\nI don\\'t know where you get your information,\\nbut he wasn\\'t my biggest fan.\\nWhat do you remember about your dad?\\nHe was cold, he was calculating.\\nHe never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me,\\nso it\\'s a little tough for me to digest\\nwhen you\\'re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me\\nand he\\'s passing it down. I don\\'t get that.\\nYou\\'re talking about a guy whose happiest day\\nwas when he shipped me off to boarding school.\\nThat\\'s not true.\\nWell, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.\\nAs a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.I.D.\\nWhat?\\n- I got a 2: 00. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\n- What\\'s this? - Okay, you\\'re good, right?\\n- No, I\\'m not good. - You got this? Right?

I\\'ll put in a little time at the lab.\\nIf we could send one of your go on squad down to The Coffee Bean,\\nCross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that\\'d be nice.\\nI\\'m not here for that.\\nI\\'ve been authorised by Director Fury\\nto use any means necessary to keep you on premises.\\nIf you attempt to leave or play any games,\\nI will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet.\\n- Okay? - I think I got it, yeah.\\nEnjoy your evening\\'s entertainment.\\nThink this is the power source?\\nMajor, this is not a scientific exercise. Let\\'s just focus on arming it, all right?\\nYes, sir.\\nOh, yes!\\nOh, yes, yes, yes.\\nIs it my birthday?\\nYou got it. What did you do? What did you do?\\n- Is this what I think it is? - Yes, it is.\\nHammer, I want to know what you\\'re gonna do for us.\\nWhat am I going to do for you?\\nWell, the first thing I\\'m gonna do for you is I\\'m gonna upgrade your software.\\n- And then, second, I think I should... - That\\'s not what I\\'m talking about.\\nI\\'m talking about firepower.\\nWell, you\\'re talking to the right guy.\\nClaridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.\\nToo downtown?

We have this, don\\'t we?\\nThis is a ridiculous way...\\nEverything\\nis achievable\\nthrough technology.\\nTony?\\nYou\\'re too young to understand this right now,\\nso I thought I would put it on film for you.\\nI built this for you.\\nAnd someday you\\'ll realise that it represents a whole lot more\\nthan just people\\'s inventions. It represents my life\\'s work.\\nThis is the key to the future.\\nI\\'m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you\\'ll figure this out.\\nAnd when you do,\\nyou will change the world.\\nWhat is and always will be my greatest creation\\nis you.\\n- $6. Six. - I don\\'t have any dough.\\n- Here. - No, sir, that\\'s too much.\\nNo, it\\'s fine. Take that.\\n- It\\'s fine. - No, señor.\\nTake it. Take it.

This is crazy.\\nIt\\'s like a Ferris wheel going.\\n- I\\'m trying to get some... - No.\\nDo you know how short life is?\\nAnd if I never got to express...\\nAnd by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me.\\nAnd I don\\'t care... I mean, I care. It would be nice.\\nI\\'m not expecting you to...\\nLook, here\\'s what I\\'m trying to say.\\n- I\\'m just gonna say it. - Let me stop you right here, okay?\\nBecause if you say \"I\" one more time,\\nI\\'m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think.\\nI am trying to run a company.\\n- Do you have any idea what that entails? - Yes.\\nPeople are relying on you to be Iron Man and you\\'ve disappeared,\\nand all I\\'m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat for it.\\nI am trying to do the job that you were meant to do.\\nDid you bring me strawberries?\\nDid you know that there\\'s only one thing on Earth that I\\'m allergic to?\\nAllergic to strawberries.\\nThis is progress, Pepper.\\nI knew there was a correlation between you and this.\\n- I need you... - I need you, too.\\nTo leave now. - That\\'s what I\\'m trying to...\\nMs Potts?\\n- Hi, come on in. - Wheels up in 25 minutes.\\nThank you.\\n- Anything else, boss? - I\\'m good, Hap.\\nNo, I\\'ll be just... another minute.\\nI lost both the kids in the divorce.\\nNo.\\nAre you blending in well here, Natalie?

Nothing? - Actually, while you\\'re here,\\nmaybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.\\nAbsolutely.\\nI\\'m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.\\nBoy, you\\'re good.\\nYou are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it?\\nYou just tear things... You\\'re a triple impostor.\\nI\\'ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you?\\nDo you even speak Latin?\\nWhich means? Wait. What? What did you just say?\\nIt means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.\\nYou\\'re good.\\nJarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?\\nI need a manipulatable projection.\\n1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.\\nHow many buildings are there?\\nAm I to include the Belgian waffle stands?\\nThat was rhetorical. Just show me.\\nWhat does that look like to you, Jarvis? Not unlike an atom.\\nIn which case the nucleus would be here.\\nHighlight the unisphere.\\n- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them. - What is it you\\'re trying to achieve, sir?\\nI\\'m discovering...

We\\'re back in hardware mode.\\n- I heard you broke the perimeter. - Yeah.\\nThat was, like, three years ago. Where you been?\\n- I was doing some stuff. - Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.\\nHey, I\\'m playing for the home team, Coulson,\\nyou and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.\\nNow, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?\\nWhat\\'s this doing here?\\nThat\\'s it.\\n- Bring that to me. - You know what this is?\\nIt\\'s exactly what I need to make this work.\\nLift the coil.\\nGo, go. Put your knees into it.\\nThere you go. And...\\nDrop it. Drop it.\\nPerfectly level. I\\'m busy. What do you want?\\nNothing. Goodbye. I\\'ve been reassigned.\\nDirector Fury wants me in New Mexico.\\n- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment. - So I\\'m told.\\n- Secret stuff? - Something like that.\\n- Good luck. - Bye.\\n- Thanks. - We need you.\\n- Yeah, more than you know. - Not that much.\\nInitialising prismatic accelerator.\\nApproaching maximum power.\\nThat was easy.\\nCongratulations, sir.\\nYou have created a new element.\\nSir, the reactor has accepted the modified core.\\nI will begin running diagnostics.\\nHey, Ivan.\\nI got Senator Stern here.\\nThought we\\'d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.\\nThe drone is not going to be ready.\\nNot ready? What do you mean?\\nI can make presentation, not demonstration.\\nWhat the hell is the difference?\\nPresentation. No fly. No shoot.\\nWell, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.\\nWhat can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.\\n- I can make salute. - You can make salute?\\nWhat do you mean, \"make salute\"?\\nWhat the hell does that mean, lvan? This is not what we agreed to, okay?\\nYou promised me suits and then you promised me drones.\\n- Hey, man, everything will be okay. - This is not what I wanted.\\nHey, there he is. It\\'s the bird man.\\nNow you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I\\'m confused.\\nYou said it wasn\\'t, but now it looks like you\\'re best of pals.\\nYou love that bird, don\\'t you? You know what?\\nTake the bird.\\nHey!\\nTake his pillows, too. Both of them.\\nAnd his shoes. Take his shoes.\\nI took your stuff.\\nHow does that make you feel? Do you feel bad?\\nGood. \\'Cause that\\'s how I feel!\\nWe had a contract.\\nI saved your life\\nand you give me suits.\\nThat was our deal.\\nAnd you did not deliver.\\nI don\\'t know if you\\'re a genius or a fraud. I don\\'t know what you are.\\nSomething really, really great fell into my lap.\\nAnd if it hadn\\'t, I\\'d be at your mercy tonight.\\nNow I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.\\nAnd now your overpriced paperweights\\nare gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.\\nDo you dig what I\\'m getting at here?\\nI don\\'t know if you know this, but I don\\'t speak Russian!\\nI\\'m gonna leave now.\\nI\\'m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I\\'ll even get laid.\\nYou see these guys?

His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.\\nYeah.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about. Thanks for coming.\\nLadies and gentlemen, for far too long,\\nthis country has had to place its brave men and women in harm\\'s way,\\nbut then the Iron Man arrived,\\nand we thought the days of losing lives were behind us.\\nSadly, that technology was kept out of reach.\\nThat\\'s not fair. That\\'s not right.\\n- And it\\'s just too bad. - Oh, Lord.\\nRegardless, it was an impressive innovation,\\none that grabbed headlines the world over.\\nWell, today, my friends,\\nthe press is faced with quite a different problem.\\nThey are about to run out of ink.\\nGet that out of here.\\nLadies and gentlemen,\\ntoday I present to you\\nthe new face of the United States military.\\nThe Hammer drone.\\nArmy!\\nNavy!\\nAir Force!\\nMarines!\\nYeah!\\nThat\\'s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.\\nBut as revolutionary as this technology is,\\nthere will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war.\\nLadies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you\\nthe very first prototype\\nin the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit\\nand its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.\\nWhat?\\nFor America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for...\\nWe got trouble.\\nTony, there are civilians present.\\nI\\'m here on orders.

Why not before?\\nWhat isn\\'t he telling us?\\nI can\\'t do the equation unless I have all the variables.\\nYou think Fury\\'s hiding something?\\nHe\\'s a spy.

Isn\\'t it?\\nI just want to finish my work here, and...\\nDoctor?\\n\"A warm light for all mankind.\"\\nLoki\\'s jab at Fury about the Cube.\\nI heard it.\\nI think that was meant for you.\\nEven if Barton didn\\'t tell Loki about the tower,\\nit was still all over the news.\\nThe Stark Tower?

I\\'ll read all about it.\\nOr you\\'ll be suiting up with the rest of us.\\nYou see, I don\\'t get a suit of armour.\\nI\\'m exposed.

I just think\\nwe might have to push our 8:30 res.\\nWhy?\\nJust \\'cause I\\'ll probably\\nnot make it back for a while.\\nTell me you\\'re not on that ship.\\nYeah.\\nGod, no, please tell me you\\'re not on the ship.\\nHoney, I\\'m sorry.\\nI\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know what to say.\\nCome back here, Tony. I swear to God.\\n- Pep. - Come back here right now.\\nCome back.\\nBoss, we\\'re losing her.\\nI\\'m going too.\\nOh, my God!\\nI shoulda stayed on the bus.\\nWhere you going?\\nThe Time Stone\\'s been taken.\\nThe Sanctum remains unguarded.\\nWhat will you do?\\nI\\'m gonna make a call.\\nSing it, Drax!\\nWhy are we doing this again?\\nIt\\'s a distress signal, Rocket.\\nSomeone could be dying.\\nI get that, but why are we doing it?\\n\\'Cause we\\'re nice.\\nAnd maybe whoever it is\\nwill give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.\\n- Which isn\\'t the point. - Which isn\\'t the point.\\nI mean, if he doesn\\'t pony up...\\nWe take his ship.\\n- Exactly! - Bingo!\\nAll right!\\nWe are arriving.\\nAll right, Guardians,\\ndon\\'t forget this might be dangerous...\\nso let\\'s put on our mean faces.\\nGroot, put that thing away, now.\\nI don\\'t wanna tell you again.\\n- Groot.\\nI am Groot!\\n- Whoa! - Language!\\n- Hey! - Wow.\\nYou got some acorns on you, kid.\\nEver since you got a little sap,\\nyou\\'re a total d-hole.\\nNow, keep it up, and I\\'m gonna smash that thing to pieces.\\nWhat happened?\\nOh, my God.\\nLooks like we\\'re not getting paid.\\nWipers! Wipers!\\nGet it off.\\nHow the hell is this dude still alive?\\nHe is not a dude.\\nYou\\'re a dude.\\nThis... This is a man.\\nA handsome, muscular man.\\nI\\'m muscular.\\nBut who are you kidding, Quill?\\nYou\\'re one sandwich away from fat.\\nYeah, right.\\nIt\\'s true, Quill. You have put on weight.\\nWhat?\\nGamora, do you think I\\'m...\\nHe is anxious, angry.\\nHe feels tremendous loss and guilt.\\nIt\\'s like a pirate had a baby with an angel.\\nWow.\\nThis is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.\\nI\\'m gonna get a Bowflex. I\\'m gonna commit.\\nI\\'m gonna get some dumbbells.\\nYou know you can\\'t eat dumbbells, right?\\nIt\\'s like his muscles\\nare made of Cotati metal fibers.\\nStop massaging his muscles.\\nWake him up.\\nWake.\\nWho the hell are you guys?\\nThe entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.\\nTo bring balance to the universe\\nby wiping out half of all life.\\nHe used to kill people planet by planet,\\nmassacre by massacre.\\nIncluding my own.\\nIf he gets all six Infinity Stones...\\nhe can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.\\nYou seem to know a great deal about Thanos.\\nGamora is the daughter of Thanos.\\nYour father killed my brother.\\nOh, boy.\\nStepfather, technically.\\nAnd she hates him as much as you do.\\nFamilies can be tough.\\nBefore my father died,\\nhe told me that I had a half-sister...\\nthat he imprisoned in Hel.\\nAnd then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.\\nSo I had to kill her.\\nThat\\'s life though, isn\\'t it, I guess.\\nGoes round and round and...\\nI feel your pain.\\nI feel your pain as well, because...\\nI mean, it\\'s not a competition,\\nbut I\\'ve been through a lot.\\n- My father killed my mother.\\nAnd then I had to kill my father.\\n- That was hard.\\nProbably even harder than having to kill a sister.\\nPlus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...\\nI need a hammer, not a spoon.\\nHow do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...\\nA four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.\\n- Uh, what are you doing? - Taking your pod.\\nNo, you\\'re not.\\nYou will not be taking our pod today, sir.\\nUh... Quill, are you making your voice deeper?\\n- No. - You are.\\nYou\\'re imitating the god-man. It\\'s weird.\\nNo, I\\'m not.\\nHe just did it again! - This is my voice.\\nAre you mocking me?\\n- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.\\nHe\\'s trying to copy me.\\nI need you to stop doing that.\\nEnough! - He\\'s doing it first.\\nWe need to stop Thanos.\\nWhich means we need to find out\\nwhere he\\'s going next.\\nKnowhere.\\nHe must be going somewhere.\\nNo, no. Knowhere?\\nIt\\'s a place. We\\'ve been there. It sucks.\\n- Excuse me, that\\'s our food. - Not anymore.\\nThor, why would he go to Knowhere?\\nBecause for years...\\nthe Reality Stone\\'s been safely stored there\\nwith a man called the Collector.\\nIf it\\'s with the Collector, then it\\'s not safe.\\nOnly an idiot would give that man a stone.\\n- Or a genius. - How do you know...\\nhe\\'s not going for one of the other stones?\\nThere are six stones out there.\\nThanos already has the Power Stone...\\nbecause he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.\\nHe stole the Space Stone from me...\\nwhen he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.\\nThe Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.\\nThey\\'re with the Avengers.\\n- The Avengers? - Earth\\'s mightiest heroes.\\nLike Kevin Bacon?\\nHe may be on the team. I don\\'t know.\\nI haven\\'t been there in a while.\\nAs for the Soul Stone, well, no one\\'s ever seen that.\\nNo one even knows where it is.\\nTherefore Thanos can\\'t get it.\\nTherefore he\\'s going to Knowhere.\\nHence he\\'ll be getting the Reality Stone.\\nYou\\'re welcome.\\nThen we have to go to Knowhere now.\\nWrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.\\n- That\\'s a made-up word. - All words are made up.\\nNidavellir is real? Seriously?\\nThat place is a legend.\\nThey make the most powerful, horrific weapons\\nto ever torment the universe.\\nI would very much like to go there, please.\\nThe rabbit is correct\\nand clearly the smartest among you.\\nRabbit?\\nOnly Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.\\nI assume you\\'re the captain, sir.\\nYou\\'re very perceptive.\\nYou seem like a noble leader.\\nWill you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?\\nLet me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it\\'s me!\\n- Yeah. I\\'ll go. - Wonderful!\\nUh, except for that I\\'m the captain.\\nQuiet.\\n- That\\'s my backpack. - Go sit down.\\nLook, this is my ship.\\nAnd I\\'m not goin\\' to...\\nWait, what kinda weapon are we talkin\\' about here?\\nThe Thanos-killing kind.\\nDon\\'t you think that we should all have a weapon like that?\\nNo. You simply lack the strength to wield them.\\nYour bodies would crumble\\nas your minds collapsed into madness.\\nIs it weird that I wanna do it even more now?\\nMmm, a little bit, yeah.\\nIf we don\\'t go to Knowhere\\nand Thanos retrieves another stone...\\nhe\\'ll be too powerful to stop.\\n- He already is. - I got it figured out.\\nWe got two ships\\nand a large assortment of morons.\\nSo me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.\\nAnd the morons will go to Knowhere\\nto try to stop Thanos.\\n- Cool? Cool. - So cool.\\nFor the record...\\nI know that you\\'re going with him\\nbecause it\\'s where Thanos isn\\'t.\\nYou know, you really shouldn\\'t\\ntalk that way to your captain, Quill.\\nCome on, Groot.\\nPut that game down. You\\'ll rot your brain.\\nI bid you farewell and good luck, morons.\\nBye.\\nVis?\\nIs it the stone again?\\nIt\\'s as if it\\'s speaking to me.\\nWhat does it say?\\nI don\\'t... I don\\'t know, but something.\\n- Hey.\\nTell me what you feel.\\nI just feel you.\\nSo there\\'s a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow...\\nwhich would give us more time together before you went back.\\nWhat if I miss that train?\\nThere\\'s an 11:00.\\nWhat if I missed all the trains?\\nWhat if this time I didn\\'t go back?\\nBut you gave Stark your word.\\nI\\'d rather give it to you.\\nWell, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.\\nWe both made promises.\\nNot to each other.\\nWanda.\\nFor two years, we\\'ve stolen these moments...\\ntrying to see if this could work and...\\nI don\\'t know.\\nYou know what, I\\'m just gonna speak for myself.\\nI think...\\n- It works. - It works.\\nIt works.\\nStay.\\nStay with me.\\nOr not. If I\\'m overstepping...\\nWhat are they?\\nWhat the stone was warning me about.\\nI have to go.\\nNo, Vision.\\nVision, if that\\'s true,\\nthen maybe going isn\\'t the best idea.\\nWanda, I...\\n- Vision!\\nThe blade, it stopped me from phasing.\\n- Is that even possible? - It isn\\'t supposed to be.\\nMy systems are failing.\\nI\\'m beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.\\nVis!\\nGive up the stone, and she lives.\\nHands off.\\nCome on. Come on.\\nCome on, you gotta get up.\\nYou gotta get up. Come on. Hey.\\nHey. We have to go.\\nPlease. Please leave.\\nYou asked me to stay.\\n- I\\'m staying. - Please.\\n- Get up. - I can\\'t.\\nWe don\\'t wanna kill you, but we will.\\nYou\\'ll never get the chance again.\\nCan you stand?\\nThank you, Captain.\\nLet\\'s get you on the jet.\\nNow, I thought we had a deal.\\nStay close, check in, don\\'t take any chances.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nWe just wanted time.\\nWhere to, Cap?\\nHome.\\nWe\\'ll be safe. We\\'ll be safe.\\nZehobereians.\\nMother! Where\\'s my mother?\\nChoose a side or die.\\nMother!\\nOne side is a revelation...\\nthe other an honor known only to a few.\\nWhat\\'s wrong, little one?\\nMy mother. Where is my mother?\\nWhat\\'s your name?\\nGamora.\\nYou\\'re quite the fighter, Gamora.\\nCome.\\nLet me help you.\\nLook.\\nPretty, isn\\'t it?\\nPerfectly balanced, as all things should be.\\nToo much to one side or the other...\\nHere. You try.\\nNow, go in peace to meet your maker.\\n- Uh-uh.\\nConcentrate.\\nThere. You\\'ve got it.\\nGamora.\\nDo you know if these grenades\\nare the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?\\nBecause I was thinking about\\nhanging a couple on my belt right here.\\nBut I don\\'t want to if they\\'re the...\\nI need to ask a favor.\\nYeah, sure.\\nOne way or another,\\nthe path that we\\'re on leads to Thanos.\\nWhich is what the grenades are for.\\nUh, I\\'m sorry. What\\'s the favor?\\nIf things go wrong...\\nIf Thanos gets me...\\nI want you to promise me...\\nyou\\'ll kill me.\\nWhat?\\nI know something he doesn\\'t.\\nAnd if he finds it out,\\nthe entire universe could be at risk.\\nWhat do you know?\\nIf I tell you, you\\'d know too.\\nIf it\\'s so important...\\nshouldn\\'t I?\\nOnly if you wanna die.\\nWhy does somebody always have to die in this scenario?\\nJust...\\nTrust me. And possibly kill me.\\nI mean, I\\'d like to.\\n- I really would. But you...\\nSwear to me.\\nSwear to me on your mother.\\nOkay.\\nOkay.\\n- Oh. - Dude.\\nHow long have you been standing there?\\nAn hour.\\nAn hour?\\nAre you serious?\\nI\\'ve mastered the ability\\nof standing so incredibly still...\\nthat I become invisible to the eye.\\nWatch.\\nYou\\'re eating a zarg-nut.\\nBut my movement...\\nwas so slow...\\nthat it\\'s imperceptible.\\nMmm, no.\\nI\\'m sure I\\'m invisible.\\nHi, Drax.\\nDamn it.\\nThis place looks deserted.\\nI\\'m reading movement in the third quadrant.\\nYep, I\\'m picking that up too.\\nLet\\'s put down right here.\\nI don\\'t have it.\\nEveryone in the galaxy knows\\nyou\\'d sell your own brother...\\nif you thought it would add even the slightest trinket...\\nto your pathetic collection.\\nI know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.\\nGiving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.\\nI told you.\\nI sold it.\\nWhy would I lie?\\nI imagine it\\'s like breathing for you.\\nLike suicide.\\nYou do understand.\\nNot even you would surrender something so precious.\\nI didn\\'t know what it was.\\nThen you\\'re more of a fool than I took you for.\\nIt\\'s him.\\nLast chance, charlatan.\\nWhere\\'s the stone?\\nToday...\\nDrax. Drax.\\n...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.\\nDrax, wait.\\nNot yet, not yet, not yet.\\nDrax.\\nDrax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.\\nHe doesn\\'t have the stone yet.\\nIf we get it, then we can stop him.\\nWe have to get the stone first. Yeah.\\nNo.\\nNo. For Ovette, for Camaria.\\nSleep.\\nOkay.\\nGamora, Mantis, you go right.\\nThe other right.\\nWhy?\\nWhy you, daughter?\\nThat was quick.\\nMagnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!\\nIs that sadness I sense in you, daughter?\\nIn my heart, I knew you still cared.\\nBut one never knows for sure.\\nReality is often disappointing.\\nThat is, it was.\\nNow...\\nreality can be whatever I want.\\nYou knew I\\'d come.\\nI counted on it.\\nThere\\'s something we need to discuss, little one.\\nThanos!\\nNo!\\nLet her go, Grimace.\\nPeter.\\nI told you to go right.\\nNow? Really?\\nYou let her go!\\n- Ah, the boyfriend.\\nNo.\\nLike to think of myself\\nmore as a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.\\n- Let her go. - Peter.\\nI\\'m gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.\\nNot him.\\nYou promised. You promised.\\nOh, daughter.\\nYou expect too much from him.\\nShe\\'s asked, hasn\\'t she?\\nDo it.\\nMmm.\\n- Do it!\\nI told you to go right.\\nI love you more than anything.\\nI love you too.\\nI like him.\\nStill no word from Vision?\\nSatellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.\\nOn a stolen Quinjet\\nwith four of the world\\'s most wanted criminals.\\nYou know they\\'re only criminals because\\nyou\\'ve chosen to call them that, right, sir?\\nMy God, Rhodes.\\nYour talent for horseshit rivals my own.\\nIf it weren\\'t for those Accords,\\nVision would\\'ve been right here.\\nI remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.\\nThat\\'s right.\\nAnd I\\'m pretty sure I paid for that.\\nYou have second thoughts?\\nNot anymore.\\nMr. Secretary.\\nYou got some nerve.\\nI\\'ll give you that.\\nYou could use some of that right now.\\nThe world\\'s on fire.\\nAnd you think all is forgiven?\\nI\\'m not looking for forgiveness.\\nAnd I\\'m way past asking permission.\\nEarth just lost her best defender.\\nSo we\\'re here to fight.\\nAnd if you wanna stand in our way...\\nwe\\'ll fight you too.\\nArrest them.\\nAll over it.\\nThat\\'s a court-martial.\\nIt\\'s great to see you, Cap.\\n- You too, Rhodey.\\nHey.\\nWow. You guys...\\nreally look like crap.\\nMust\\'ve been a rough couple years.\\nYeah, well, the hotels weren\\'t exactly five star.\\nUh, I think you look great.\\nUh...\\nYeah, I\\'m back.\\nHi, Bruce.\\nNat.\\nThis is awkward.\\nSo we gotta assume they\\'re coming back, right?\\nAnd they can clearly find us.\\nWe need all hands on deck. Where\\'s Clint?\\nAfter the whole Accords situation,\\nhe and Scott took a deal. It was too tough\\non their families. They\\'re on house arrest.\\n- Who\\'s Scott? - Ant-Man.\\nThere\\'s an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?\\nOkay, look.\\nThanos has the biggest army in the universe...\\nand he is not gonna stop until he gets...\\nVision\\'s stone.\\nThen we have to protect it.\\nNo, we have to destroy it.\\nI\\'ve been giving a good deal of thought\\nto this entity in my head.\\nAbout its nature.\\nBut also its composition.\\nI think if it were exposed\\nto a sufficiently powerful energy source...\\nsomething very similar to its own signature, perhaps...\\nits molecular integrity could fail.\\nYeah, and you with it.\\nWe\\'re not having this conversation.\\nEliminating the stone is the only way\\nto be certain that Thanos can\\'t get it.\\nThat\\'s too high a price.\\nOnly you have the power to pay it.\\nThanos threatens half the universe.\\nOne life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.\\nBut it should.\\nWe don\\'t trade lives, Vision.\\nCaptain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...\\nto save how many millions of people?\\nTell me, why is this any different?\\nBecause you might have a choice.\\nYour mind is made up\\nof a complex construct of overlays.\\nJarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.\\nAll of them mixed together,\\nall of them learning from one another.\\nYou\\'re saying Vision isn\\'t just the stone?\\nI\\'m saying that if we take out the stone...\\nthere\\'s still a whole lot of Vision left.\\nPerhaps the best parts.\\nCan we do that?\\nNot me, not here.\\nWell, you better find someone\\nand somewhere fast.\\nRoss isn\\'t just gonna let you guys\\nhave your old rooms back.\\nI know somewhere.\\nThe Kingsguard\\nand the Dora Milaje have been alerted.\\nAnd the Border Tribe?\\nThose that are left.\\nSend word to the Jabari as well.\\nM\\'Baku likes a good fight.\\nAnd what of this one?\\nThis one may be tired of war.\\nBut the White Wolf has rested long enough.\\nWhere\\'s the fight?\\nOn its way.\\nIn all the time I\\'ve served Thanos...\\nI have never failed him.\\nIf I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...\\nwith the Time Stone still attached\\nto your vaguely irritating person...\\nthere would be judgment.\\nGive me...\\nthe stone.\\nWow, you\\'re a seriously\\nloyal piece of outerwear, aren\\'t you?\\nYeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...\\nWhat the...\\n- I know what you\\'re gonna say. - You should not be here.\\n- I was gonna go home. - I don\\'t wanna hear it.\\nBut it was such a long way down and I just thought\\n- about you on the way... - And now I gotta hear it.\\n...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.\\nAnd this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.\\nGod damn it.\\nSo, if anything, it\\'s kinda your fault that I\\'m here.\\n- What did you just say? - I take that back.\\nAnd now, I\\'m here in space.\\nYeah, right where I didn\\'t want you to be.\\nThis isn\\'t Coney Island. This isn\\'t a field trip.\\nThis is a one-way ticket.\\nYou hear me? Don\\'t pretend you thought this through.\\nNo, I did think this through.\\nYou could not have possibly thought this through.\\nYou can\\'t be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...\\nif there\\'s no neighborhood.\\nOkay, that didn\\'t really make sense,\\nbut you know what I\\'m trying to say.\\nCome on. We got a situation.\\nSee him down there? He\\'s in trouble.\\nWhat\\'s your plan?\\n- Go. - Um...\\nOkay, okay... Uh...\\nOkay. Did you ever see this really old movie, \"Aliens?\"\\nPainful, aren\\'t they?\\nThey were originally designed for microsurgery.\\n- And any one of them...\\ncould end your friend\\'s life in an instant.\\nI gotta tell you, he\\'s not really my friend.\\nSaving his life is more of a professional courtesy.\\nYou\\'ve saved nothing.\\nYour powers are inconsequential\\ncompared to mine.\\nYeah, but the kid\\'s seen more movies.\\nYes! Wait. What are those?\\nHey, we haven\\'t officially met.\\nCool.\\nWe gotta turn this ship around.\\nYeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.\\nNo, I want to protect the stone.\\nAnd I want you to thank me.\\nNow, go ahead. I\\'m listening.\\nFor what? Nearly blasting me into space?\\nWho just saved your magical ass? Me.\\nI seriously don\\'t know\\nhow you fit your head into that helmet.\\nAdmit it, you should\\'ve ducked out when I told you to.\\nI tried to bench you. You refused.\\nUnlike everyone else in your life, I don\\'t work for you.\\nAnd due to that fact,\\nwe\\'re now in a flying doughnut...\\nbillions of miles from Earth with no backup.\\n- I\\'m backup. - No, you\\'re a stowaway.\\nThe adults are talking.\\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m confused as to the relationship here.\\nWhat is he, your ward?\\nNo.\\n- I\\'m Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.\\nOh, you\\'re using our made-up names. Um...\\nI\\'m Spider-Man, then.\\nThis ship is self-correcting its course.\\nThing\\'s on autopilot.\\nCan we control it?\\nFly us home?\\n- Stark? - Yeah.\\nCan you get us home?\\nYeah, I heard you.\\nI\\'m thinking I\\'m not so sure we should.\\nUnder no circumstances\\ncan we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.\\nI don\\'t think you quite understand\\nwhat\\'s at stake here.\\nWhat? No. It\\'s you who doesn\\'t understand...\\nthat Thanos has been inside my head for six years.\\nSince he sent an army to New York\\nand now he\\'s back.\\nAnd I don\\'t know what to do.\\nSo I\\'m not so sure\\nif it\\'s a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...\\nbut you saw what they did, what they can do.\\nAt least on his turf, he\\'s not expecting it.\\nSo I say we take the fight to him.\\nDoctor.\\nDo you concur?\\nAll right, Stark. We go to him.\\nBut you have to understand...\\nif it comes to saving you\\nor the kid or the Time Stone...\\nI will not hesitate to let either of you die.\\nI can\\'t, because the universe depends on it.\\nNice. Good, moral compass.\\nWe\\'re straight.\\nAll right, kid.\\nYou\\'re an Avenger now.\\nI thought you might be hungry.\\nI always hated that chair.\\nSo I\\'ve been told.\\nEven so, I\\'d hoped you\\'d sit in it one day.\\nI hated this room.\\nThis ship.\\nI hated my life.\\nYou told me that too.\\nEvery day.\\nFor almost 20 years.\\nI was a child when you took me.\\nI saved you.\\nNo.\\nNo. We were happy on my home planet.\\nGoing to bed hungry...\\nscrounging for scraps.\\nYour planet was on the brink of collapse.\\nI\\'m the one who stopped that.\\nDo you know what\\'s happened since then?\\nThe children born...\\nhave known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.\\nIt\\'s a paradise.\\nBecause you murdered half the planet.\\nA small price to pay for salvation.\\nYou\\'re insane.\\nLittle one, it\\'s a simple calculus.\\nThis universe is finite, its resources finite.\\nIf life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.\\nIt needs correction.\\nYou don\\'t know that!\\nI\\'m the only one who knows that.\\nAt least, I\\'m the only one with the will to act on it.\\nFor a time...\\nyou had that same will...\\nas you fought by my side.\\nDaughter.\\nI\\'m not your daughter.\\nEverything I hate about myself you taught me.\\nAnd, in doing so,\\nmade you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.\\nThat\\'s why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.\\nI\\'m sorry I disappointed you.\\nI am disappointed.\\nBut not because you didn\\'t find it.\\nBut because you did.\\nAnd you lied.\\nNebula.\\nDon\\'t do this.\\nSome time ago,\\nyour sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.\\nPlease don\\'t do this.\\nAnd very nearly succeeded.\\nSo I brought her here.\\nTo talk.\\nStop. Stop it.\\nI swear to you on my life.\\nI never found the Soul Stone.\\nAccessing memory files.\\nYou know what he\\'s about to do.\\nHe\\'s finally ready, and he\\'s going for the stones.\\n- All of them. - He can never get them all.\\nHe will!\\nHe can\\'t, Nebula.\\nBecause I found the map to the Soul Stone...\\nand I burned it to ash. I burned it.\\nYou\\'re strong.\\nMe.\\nYou\\'re generous.\\nMe.\\nBut I never taught you to lie.\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re so bad at it.\\nWhere is the Soul Stone?\\nVormir!\\nThe stone is on Vormir.\\nShow me.\\nI am Groot.\\nTinkle in the cup.\\nWe\\'re not looking. What\\'s there to see?\\nWhat\\'s a twig? Everybody\\'s seen a twig before.\\nI am Groot.\\nTree, pour what\\'s in the cup\\nout into space and go in the cup again.\\nYou speak Groot?\\nYes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.\\nI am Groot.\\nYou\\'ll know when we\\'re close.\\nNidavellir\\'s forge harnesses\\nthe blazing power of a neutron star.\\nIt\\'s the birthplace of my hammer.\\nIt\\'s truly awesome.\\nOkay, time to be the captain.\\nSo, dead brother, huh?\\nYeah, that could be annoying.\\nWell, he\\'s been dead before.\\nBut, no, this time I think it really might be true.\\nAnd you said your sister and your dad?\\nBoth dead.\\nBut still got a mom, though?\\nKilled by a dark elf.\\nA best friend?\\nStabbed through the heart.\\nYou sure you\\'re up to this particular murder mission?\\nAbsolutely.\\nRage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...\\nthey\\'re all tremendous motivators.\\nThey really clear the mind.\\nSo I\\'m good to go.\\nYeah, but this Thanos we\\'re talkin\\' about...\\nhe\\'s the toughest there is.\\n- Well, he\\'s never fought me. - Yeah, he has.\\nHe\\'s never fought me twice.\\nAnd I\\'m getting a new hammer, don\\'t forget.\\nIt better be some hammer.\\nYou know, I\\'m 1,500 years old.\\nI\\'ve killed twice as many enemies as that.\\nAnd every one of them would\\'ve rather killed me,\\nbut none succeeded.\\nI\\'m only alive because fate wants me alive.\\nThanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...\\nand he\\'ll be the latest to feel my vengeance.\\nFate wills it so.\\nMmm-hmm.\\nAnd what if you\\'re wrong?\\nIf I\\'m wrong, then...\\nwhat more could I lose?\\nI could lose a lot.\\nMe, personally, I could lose a lot.\\nOkay.\\nIf fate does want you to kill that crapsack...\\nyou\\'re gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.\\n- What\\'s this? - What\\'s it look like?\\nSome jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.\\nHe gave you his eye?\\nNo, he gave me 100 credits.\\nI snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.\\nThank you, sweet rabbit.\\nHmm.\\nHuh?\\nOh.\\nI would\\'ve washed that.\\nThe only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...\\nHey, we\\'re here!\\nI don\\'t think this thing works.\\nEverything seems dark.\\nIt ain\\'t the eye.\\nSomething\\'s wrong.\\nThe star\\'s gone out.\\nAnd the rings are frozen.\\nI hope these dwarves are better\\nat forging than they are cleaning.\\nMaybe they realized that they live\\nin a junk pile in the middle of space.\\nThis forge hasn\\'t gone dark in centuries.\\nYou said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?\\nYes, why?\\nIt look anything like that?\\nI am Groot.\\nGo back to the pod.\\nEitri, wait!\\nStop!\\nStop.\\nThor?\\nWhat happened here?\\nYou were supposed to protect us.\\nAsgard was supposed to protect us.\\nAsgard is destroyed.\\nEitri, the glove. What did you do?\\n300 dwarves lived on this ring.\\nI thought if I did what he asked, they\\'d be safe.\\nI made what he wanted.\\nA device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.\\nThen he killed everyone anyway.\\nAll except me.\\n\"Your life is yours,\" he said.\\n\"But your hands are mine alone.\"\\nEitri, this isn\\'t about your hands.\\nEvery weapon you\\'ve ever designed,\\nevery axe, hammer, sword...\\nit\\'s all inside your head.\\nNow, I know it feels like all hope is lost.\\nTrust me, I know.\\nBut together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.\\nMantis, listen very carefully.\\nI need you to meet me on Titan.\\nHey, what\\'s going on?\\nI think we\\'re here.\\nI don\\'t think this rig has a self-park function.\\nGet your hand inside the steering gimbal.\\nClose those around it.\\n- You understand? - Yep, got it.\\nThis was meant for one big guy, so we gotta\\n- move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.\\n- We might wanna turn.\\nTurn! Turn! Turn!\\nYou all right?\\nThat was close.\\nI owe you one.\\nLet me just say, if aliens\\nwind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...\\nand I eat one of you, I\\'m sorry.\\nI do not want another single pop culture reference\\nout of you for the rest of the trip.

Please don\\'t put your eggs in me!\\n- Stay down, clown.\\nDie, blanket of death!\\nEverybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.\\nI\\'m gonna ask you this one time.\\nWhere is Gamora?\\nYeah.

mind i humbly present the crown jewel of stark industries freedom line its the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology they say the best weapon is one you never have to fire i respectfully disagree i prefer the weapon you only have to fire once thats how dad did it thats how america does it and its worked out pretty well so far find an excuse to let one of these off the chain and i personally guarantee you the bad guys wont even want to come out of their caves for your consideration the jericho ill be throwing one of these in with every purchase of  million or more to peace  tony  obie what are you doing up i couldnt sleep till i found out how it went howd it go it went great looks like its gonna be an early christmas hey way to go my boy ill see you

have a souvenir take a look ive seen many wounds like that in my village we call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs  what is this  that is an electromagnet hooked up to a car battery and its keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart thats right smile we met once you know at a technical conference in bern  i dont remember  no you wouldnt if i had been that drunk i wouldnt have been able to stand much less give a lecture on integrated circuits where are we come on stand up stand up just do as i do come on put your hands up those are my guns how did they get my guns do you understand me do as i do he says welcome tony stark the most famous mass murderer in the history of america he is honored he wants you to build the missile the jericho missile that you demonstrated this one i refuse tony he wants to know what you think i think you got a lot of my weapons he says they have everything you need to build the jericho missile he wants you to make the list of materials he says for you to start working immediately and when youre done he will set you free  no he wont  no he wont im sure theyre looking for you stark but they will never find you in these mountains look what you just saw that is your legacy stark your lifes work in the hands of those murderers is that how you want to go out is this the last act of defiance of the great tony stark or are you going to do something about it why should i do anything theyre going to kill me you either way and if they dont ill probably be dead in a week well then this is a very

about to begin right now im not a reporter im agent phil coulson with the strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division  thats quite a mouthful  i know were working on it you know weve been approached already by the dod the fbi the cia were a separate division with a more specific focus we need to debrief mr stark about the circumstances of his escape  ill put something in the book shall i  thank you hey would it be all right if everyone sat down why dont you just sit down that way you can see me and i can a little less formal and  whats up with the lovein  dont look at me i dont know what hes up to  good to see you  good to see you i never got to say goodbye to dad i never got to say goodbye to my father theres questions that i would have asked him i would have asked him how he felt about what this company did if he was conflicted if he ever had doubts or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels i saw young americans killed by the very weapons i created to defend them and protect them and i saw that i had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability  mr stark  hey ben what happened over there i had my eyes opened i came to realize that i have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up and that is why effective immediately i am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of stark international until such a time as i can decide what the future of the company will be i think were gonna be selling a lot of newspapers what direction it should take one that im comfortable with and

three two one handles like a dream all right lets see what this thing can do whats sr s record the altitude record for fixed wing flight is  feet sir records are made to be broken come on sir there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring keep going higher we iced up jarvis deploy flaps jarvis come on we got to break the ice kill power notes main transducer feels sluggish at plus  altitude hull pressurization is problematic im thinking icing is the probable factor a very astute observation sir perhaps if you intend to visit other planets we should improve the exosystems connect to the sys co have it reconfigure the shell metals use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite that should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining powertoweight ratio  got it  yes

business if were doubledealing under the table are we tony your picture please lets take a picture come on picture time tony who do you think locked you out i was the one who filed the injunction against you it was the only way i could protect you no no the mile hike to the outskirts of gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell into a modern day heart of darkness simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a newfound power villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages or here in the remnants of an old soviet smelting plant recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the ten rings as you can see these men are heavily armed and on a mission a mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way with no political will or international pressure theres very little hope for these refugees around me a woman begging for news on her husband who was kidnapped by insurgents either forced to join their militia desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs holding them up to anyone who will stop a childs simple question where are my mother and father theres very little hope for these refugees refugees who can only wonder who if anyone will help hurry it

what im working on no no no no no no the less i know the better now what am i supposed to tell the press training exercise isnt that the usual bs its not that simple an unfortunate training exercise involving an f raptor occurred yesterday i am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured as for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in gulmira it is still unclear who or what intervened but i can assure you that the united states government was not involved hey it is a tight fit sir sir the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt be gentle this is my first time i designed this to come off so hey  i really should be able to  please try not to move sir whats going on here lets face it this is not the worst thing youve caught me doing are those bullet holes welcome compliments of tony stark if youd killed him when you were supposed to youd still have a face you paid us trinkets to kill a prince show me the weapon come leave your guards outside his escape bore unexpected fruit so this is how he did it this is only a first crude effort stark has perfected his design he has made a masterpiece of death a man with a dozen of these can rule all of asia and you dream of starks throne we have a common enemy if we are still in business i will give you these designs as a gift and in turn i hope youll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers this is the only gift you shall receive technology its always been your achilles heel in this part of the world dont worry itll only last for  minutes thats the least of your problems crate up the armor and the rest of it all right lets finish up here set up sector  underneath the arc reactor and im going to want this data masked recruit our top engineers i want a prototype right away hey you busy you mind if i send you on an errand i need you to go to my office youre going to hack into the mainframe and youre going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests this is a lock chip thisll get you in its probably under executive files if not they put it on a ghost drive in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading and what do you plan to do with this information if i bring it back here same drill theyve been dealing under the table and im going to stop them im going to find my weapons and destroy them tony you know that i would help you with anything but i cannot help you if youre going to start all of this again there is nothing except this theres no art opening there is no benefit there is nothing to sign there is the next mission and nothing else is that so well then i quit you stood by my side all these years while i reaped the benefits of destruction and now that im trying to protect the people that i put in harms way youre going to walk out youre going to kill yourself tony im not going to be a part of it i shouldnt be alive unless it was for a reason im not crazy pepper i just finally know what i have to do and i know in my heart that its right youre all i have too you know sector  what are you up to obadiah you did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great tony stark  as you can see obadiah stane  oh my god your deception and lies will cost you dearly the price to kill tony stark has just gone up so what are we going to do about this i know what youre going through pepper tony he always gets the good stuff doesnt he i was so happy when he came home it was like we got him back from the dead now i realize well tony never really did come home did he he left a part of himself in that cave breaks my heart well hes a complicated person hes been through a lot i think hell be all right you are a very rare woman tony doesnt know how lucky he is thank you thanks id better get back there is that todays paper yes do you mind  not at all  puzzle of course take care ms potts we had an appointment did you forget about our appointment nope right now come with me  right now  were going to have it right now  yeah walk with me  okay im going to give you the meeting of your life your office yeah weve been working our best to do it absolutely were im going to have to call you back mr stane sir weve explored what youve asked us and it seems as though theres a little hiccup  actually  a hiccup yes to power the suit sir the technology actually doesnt exist  so its  wait wait wait the technology william here is the technology ive asked you to simply make it smaller okay sir and thats what were trying to do but honestly its impossible tony stark was able to build this in a cave with a box of scraps well im sorry im not tony stark tony tony are you there hello breathe easy easy you remember this one right its a shame the government didnt approve it theres so many applications for causing shortterm paralysis tony when i ordered the hit on you i worried that i was killing the golden goose but you see it was just fate that you survived that you had one last golden egg to give do you really think that just because you have an idea it belongs to you your father he helped give us the atomic bomb now what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you oh its beautiful tony this is your ninth symphony what a masterpiece look at that this is your legacy a new generation of weapons with this at its heart weapons that will help steer the world back on course put the balance of power in our hands the right hands i wish you could see my prototype its not as well not as conservative as yours too bad you had to involve pepper in this i would have preferred that she lived what do you mean he paid to have tony killed pepper slow down why would obadiah okay wheres tony now i dont know hes not answering his phone please go over there and make sure everythings okay thank you rhodey i know a shortcut good boy tony tony tony you okay  wheres pepper  shes fine shes with five agents theyre about to arrest obadiah thats not going to be enough section  section  there it is my keys not working its not

do it you need me to do anything else keep the skies clear damn next time baby looks like you were right he was building a suit i thought itd be bigger take him out how do you think the mark i chest piece is going to hold up the suits at  power and falling sir that chest piece was never designed for sustained flight keep me posted pepper  tony tony are you okay  im fine how are  obadiah hes gone insane  i know  listen youd better get out of there  he built a suit get out of there right now where do you think youre going your services are no longer required stane i love this suit  put them down  collateral damage tony divert power to chest rt power reduced to  lady no no no no no no for  years ive been holding you up i built this company from nothing nothing is going to stand in my way least of all you impressive youve upgraded your armor ive made some upgrades of my own sir it appears that his suit can fly duly noted take me to maximum altitude with only  power the odds of reaching that i know the math do it sir youre not going to believe this that thing is back get me major allen scramble the jets not necessary people just a training exercise yes sir  thirteen percent power sir  climb  eleven percent  keep going  seven percent power  just leave it on the screen stop telling me you had a great idea tony but my suit is more advanced in every way howd you solve the icing problem icing problem might want to look into it two percent we are now running on emergency backup power  potts  tony oh my god are you okay im almost out of power ive got to get out of this thing ill be right there nice try  weapons status  repulsors offline missiles offline flares very clever tony  potts  tony this isnt working were going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof  well how are you going to do that  youre going to do it go to the central console open up all the circuits when i get clear of the roof ill let you know youre going to hit the master bypass button its going to fry everything up here okay im going in now make sure you wait till i clear the roof ill buy you some time this looks important i never had a taste for this sort of thing but i must admit im deeply enjoying the suit you finally outdid yourself tony youd have made your father proud its ready tony get off the roof tony how ironic tony trying to rid the world of weapons you gave it its best one ever  pepper  and now im going to kill you with it  you ripped out my targeting system  time to hit the button  you told me not to  hold still you little prick  just do it  youll die push it tony youve all received the official statement of what occurred at stark industries last night there have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor fortunately a member of tony starks personal security staff iron man thats kind of catchy its got a nice ring to it i mean its not technically accurate the suits a goldtitanium alloy but its kind of evocative the imagery anyway heres your alibi okay  you were on your yacht  yeah we have port papers that put you in avalon all night and sworn statements from  of your guests see i was thinking maybe we should say it was just pepper and me alone on the island  thats what happened  all right just read it word for word theres nothing about stane here thats being handled hes on vacation small aircraft have such a poor safety record but what about the whole cover story that its a bodyguard hes my i mean is that thats kind of flimsy dont you think this isnt my first rodeo mr stark just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you youve got  seconds agent coulson i just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help thats what we do youll be hearing from us  from the strategic homeland  just call us shield right  lets get this show on the road  you know its actually not that bad even i dont think im iron man  youre not iron man  am so  youre not  all right suit yourself you know if i were iron man id have this girlfriend who knew my true identity shed be a wreck cause shed always be worrying that i was going to die yet so proud of the man id become shed be wildly conflicted which would only make her more crazy about me tell me you never think about that night  what night  you know are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof and then you went downstairs to get me a drink and you left me there by myself is that the night youre talking about thought so  will that be all mr stark  yes that will be all miss potts and now mr stark has prepared a statement he will not be taking any questions thank you been a while since i was in front of you i figure ill stick to the cards this time theres been speculation that i was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop im sorry mr stark but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared  despite the fact that you  i know that its confusing it is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations or insinuate that im a superhero i never said you were a superhero didnt well good because that would be outlandish and fantastic im just not the hero type clearly with this laundry list of character defects all the mistakes ive made  largely public  just stick to the cards man yeah okay yeah the truth is i am iron man jarvis welcome home sir i am iron man you think youre the only superhero in the world mr stark youve become part of a bigger universe you just dont know it yet who the hell are you nick fury director of shield im here to talk to you about the avenger initiativenick this was a tragedy but its

mustve known i wasnt ready for something like this why give it to you maybe he didnt trust me to have edith he just trusted me to pick who should it makes much more sense he knew id do whats right and hes not gonna give them to fury because fury would give himself edith youre probably right right so the world needs the next iron man and its not me im a yearold kid from queens it needs to be an adult with some experience and thats good like tony stark like you no peter come on no edith hello peter hi yeah id like to transfer your control over to quentin beck peter what are you doing doing

this stupid costume off me okay we got edith get these connected to our system toast toast toast no this is a big win but we still got a lot of work to do toast toast toast yeah okay toasts give me that doug to the man who brought us all together our former boss tony stark the jester king literally wrapped in wealth and technology that he was unfit to wield like the holographic system i designed a revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications that tony turned into a selftherapy machine and renamed binarily augmented retroframing or barf oh  million for my little therapeutic experiment he renamed my lifes work barf i told him it was a mistake that my technology could change the world and then he fired me said i was unstable to tony to tony next to william william tony stark was able to build this in a cave with a box of scraps the integration of my illusion tech with your weaponized drones was brilliant powerful illusions real damage worked like a charm and its just the beginning thank you brother to guterman guterman to guterman the story you created of a soldier from another earth named quentin fighting space monsters in europe is totally ridiculous and apparently the kind of thing people will believe right now i mean everybody bought it gutes guterman to victoria to victoria staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site so furys own satellites would confirm our lies inspired idea to janice janice after tony died she was the one who discovered that edith was being handed over not to us not to the defense department but to a child thank you to janice and to the rest of you tony stark is gone there is a window of opportunity and someone will step up but these days you can be the smartest guy in the room the most qualified and no one cares unless youre flying around with a cape or shooting lasers from your hands no one will even listen well ive got a cape and lasers with our technology and with edith mysterio will be the greatest hero on earth yeah then everyone will listen not to a boozy manchild no not to a hormonal teenager no to me and to my very wealthy crew to us to us to mysterio to mysterio to peter parker to peter parker poor kid lets get to work peter oh my god hey hey we almost died its fine its fine hey im done with the mission dude the trips over what theres monsters coming out of the ground of course our parents

and i had this plan that i wanted to tell you im just gonna tell you mj i im spiderman what thats what you were gonna say that youre spiderman no im not spiderman ive been watching you for a while now

cant have seen me because im not spiderman also on the news it was the night monkey the night monkey yeah thats what it said on the news and the news never lies night monkey okay what are you doing well do the night monkey and spiderman use the same webs i mean maybe maybe hes a spider monkey who knows were you only watching me because you thought i was spiderman yeah why else would i be watching you doesnt matter just thought that maybe what the hell was that i dont know what is it some kind of projector or something yeah but its really advanced it it looked so real it yeah really real wait does that mean that the elementals are fake that doesnt make any sense because we were there right there was fire and destruction and who would do something like that mysterio i am spiderman and ive really messed up wait youre being serious youre  percent serious because its not funny no im not joking because i was i was only like  percent sure mj so why are you here why are you on this school trip i know you have a lot of questions but we have to get out of here okay okay okay i cant believe i figured it out you took everything from me this is for my family pause pause sorry yeah can you just fastforward to the end yep stand by all right fly fly fly zap zap zap pause im not in love with this choreography but itll do kill image decloak drones all right weapons you want to

cover your ears that is good thats good we on schedule oh yeah uploading software hack to edith network with her drones well create an event big enough to cover an entire city all right well done make sure every drone is weaponshot we need maximum damage that is gonna cause a lot of casualties oh yeah more casualties more coverage i gotta cut through the static london is a beautiful city and it will suffer but they can rebuild if im the next iron man i need to save the world from an avengerslevel threat but when its new savior descends all those casualties will be forgotten janice youll be in position with my quickchange armor for the victory lap of course do you wanna try no no thats whats going on with my hand why is that happening oh one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector its fine wait and youre youre telling me this now its its one drone the image will be perfect i promise that projector is evidence its going to tell people what were doing and how were doing it i am trying to fool  billion people here including nick fury who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet if he catches on before ive killed him he will put a bullet in my head and nobody wants a bullet in their head right right william can you look at me pull up edith hello quentin hi honey i need a levelfive search fullresource protocol for this device magnifying there search everything going in and out of that building located shit you know william one day after ive had to kill peter parker because of this i hope you remember that his

you with revelations about last weeks attack in london an anonymous source provided this video it shows quentin beck aka mysterio moments before his death a warning you may find this video disturbing i managed to send the elemental through the rift but i dont think im gonna make it spiderman attacked me for some reason he has an army of weaponized drones stark technology hes saying hes the only one whos gonna be the new iron man no one else are you sure you want to commence the drone attack there will be significant casualties do it execute them all this shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website thedailybuglenet there you have it folks conclusive proof that spiderman was responsible for the murder of mysterio an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time but thats not all folks heres the real blockbuster brace yourselves spidermans real spidermans real name is spidermans name is peter parker what the fu you gotta tell him it was fine the little boy handled it we helped talos come off it how was i supposed to know that the whole thing was fake i mean that was all very convincing the performances the illusion that costume the craftsmanship in that this is just embarrassing for a shapeshifter fine hey there i hope your mission is going well we gave the glasses to parker about a week ago like you said and it was very touching you know really really quite touching talos and you know shortly after that it really kind of went off the rails and so we need you to come back because everyone kept asking where the avengers are i dont know what to say to that so youre lucky that spiderman won everybody back to work whos got my shoesnow i know what youre thinking oh no thors in a cage how did this happen well sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody its a long story but basically im a bit of a hero see i spent some time on earth fought some robots saved the planet a couple of times then i went searching through the cosmos for some magic colorful infinity stone things didnt find any thats when i came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage where i met you how much longer do you think well be here thor son of odin surtur son of a bitch youre still alive i thought my father killed you a half a million years ago i cannot die not until i fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home its funny you should mention that because ive been having these terrible dreams of late asgard up in flames falling to ruins and you surtur are at the center of all of them then you have seen ragnarok the fall of asgard  the great prophecy  hang on hang on ill be back around shortly i really feel like we were connecting there okay so ragnarok tell me about that walk me through it my time has come when my crown is reunited with the eternal flame i shall be restored to my full might i will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in asgards hang on give it a second i swear im not even moving its just doing this on its own im really sorry okay so let me get this straight youre going to put your crown into the eternal flame and then youll suddenly grow as big as a house a mountain the eternal flame that odin keeps locked away on asgard odin is not on asgard and your absence has left the throne defenseless okay so where is it this crown this is my crown the source of my power oh thats a crown i thought it was a big eyebrow its a crown anyway it sounds like all i have to do to stop ragnarok is rip that thing off your head but ragnarok has already begun you cannot stop it i am asgards doom and so are you all will suffer all will burn thats intense to be honest seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle but it looks like im gonna have to choose option b where i bust out of these chains knock that tiara off your head and stash it away in asgards vault you cannot stop ragnarok why fight it because thats what heroes do wait im sorry i didnt time that right and now you have made a grave mistake odinson i make grave mistakes all the time everything seems to work out heimdall i know its been a while but i could really use a fast exit heimdall heimdall was an idiot this job should have made him rich now the job aint easy but it does have its benefits the bifrost gives me access to everything the nine realms has to offer i mean its all mine for the taking behold my stuff im particularly fond of these i pulled them out of a place on midgard called texas i even named them des and troy you see when you put them together they destroy heimdall come on stay heimdall im running short on options heimdall skurge is that important you girls are in for a treat girls well well well look who decided to pop in thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains who are you dont you remember im skurge we fought together on vanaheim right where is heimdall that traitor no one knows hes a fugitive of the throne traitor yeah you see odin charged heimdall with negligence of duty but he disappeared before the trial hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe sure hold on im supposed to announce your arrival what the hell is that oh brother this is it i take my leave you fool you didnt listen im sorry lady sif get help somebody help sorry for all ive done its all right hold on im sorry i tried to rule earth theyd be lucky to have you im sorry about that thing with the tesseract  i just couldnt help myself  i know im a trickster so mischievous sorry about that time i turned you into a frog it was a wonderful joke twas indeed hilarious you are the savior of asgard  tell my story  i will build a statue for me we will build a big statue for you with my helmet on with the big bendy horns i will tell father what you did here today i didnt do it for him i didnt do it for him no and so loki died of his wounds giving his life for ours he fought back those disgusting elves he brought peace to the realm loki my boy twas many moons ago i found you on that frostbitten battlefield on that day i did not yet see in you asgards savior no you were merely a little blue baby icicle that melted this old fools heart bravo bravo well done bravo father shit my son thor has returned greetings my boy its an interesting play whats it called the tragedy of loki of asgard the people wanted to commemorate him indeed they should i like the statue a lot better looking than he was when he was alive though a little less weaselly less greasy maybe do you know what this is the skull of surtur thats a formidable weapon do me a favor lock this away in a vault so it doesnt turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet thank you dear so its back to midgard for you is it nope ive been having this reoccurring dream lately every night i see asgard fall into ruins thats just a silly dream signs of an overactive imagination possibly but then i decide to go out there and investigate and what do i find but the nine realms completely in chaos enemies of asgard assembling plotting our demise all while you odin the protector of those nine realms are sitting here in your bathrobe eating grapes yes it is best to respect our neighbors freedom yes of course the freedom to be massacred yes besides ive been rather busy myself watching theater board meetings and security council meetings  youre really gonna make me do it  do what you know that nothing will stop mjolnir as it returns to my hand not even your face youve gone quite mad youll be executed for this then ill see you on the other side brother all right i yield behold thor  odinson  no you had one job just the one wheres odin you just couldnt stay away could you everything was fine without you asgard was prospering youve ruined everything  ask them  wheres father did you kill him you had what you wanted you had the independence you asked for okay i know exactly where he is i swear i left him right here right here on the sidewalk or right there where the building is being demolished great planning how was i supposed to know cant see into the future im not a witch no then why do you dress like one  hey  i cant believe youre alive i saw you die i mourned you i cried for you im honored ask him hi would you mind taking a picture with us sure start figuring out where he is oh my god sorry to hear that jane dumped you she didnt dump me you know i dumped her it was a

looking for my father so if i were to tell you where odin was all parties concerned would promptly return to asgard promptly great then ill help you if you knew where he was why didnt you call me i have to tell you he was adamant that he not be disturbed your father said he had chosen to remain in exile and you dont have a phone no i dont have a phone but you could have sent an electronic letter

his favor the bifrost brought me out here weeks ago  weeks ago  yes i just got here what are you whispering about time works real different around these parts on any other world id be like millions of

here the pile of rocks waving at you here yeah im actually a thing im a being allow me to introduce myself my name is korg im kind of like the leader in here im made of rocks as you can see but dont let that intimidate you you dont need to be afraid unless youre made of scissors just a little rockpaperscissor joke for you this is my very good friend over here miek hes an insect and has knives for hands youre a kronan arent you  that i am  howd you end up in here well i tried to start a revolution but didnt print enough pamphlets so hardly anyone turned up except for my mum and her boyfriend who i hate as punishment i was forced to be in here and become a gladiator bit of a promotional disaster that one but im actually organizing another revolution i dont know if youd be interested in something like that do you reckon youd be interested how did you yeah no this whole thing is a circle but not a real circle more like a freaky circle  this doesnt make any sense  no nothing makes sense here man the only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense has anyone here fought the grandmasters champion doug has doug our luck dougs dead thats right everyone who fights the grandmasters champion perishes what about you youre made of rocks perishable rock there you go another one gone yeah no i just do the smaller fights warm up the crowd and whatnot wait youre not gonna face him are you yes i am gonna fight him win and get the hell out of this place thats exactly what doug used to say see you later new doug does no one remember me has no one been taught our history look at these lies goblets and garden parties peace treaties odin proud to have it ashamed of how he got it we were unstoppable i was his weapon in the conquest that built asgards empire one by one the realms became ours but then simply because my ambition outgrew his he banished me caged me locked me away like an animal before that asgards warriors were honored their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace  odins treasures  fake most of the stuff in here is fake or weak smaller than i thought it would be thats not bad but this the eternal flame want to see what true power really looks like fenris my darling what have they done to you with the eternal flame you are reborn ive missed you ive missed you all odin i bid you take your place in the halls of valhalla where the brave shall live forever nor shall we mourn but rejoice for those that have died the glorious death hurts doesnt it being lied to being told youre one thing and then learning its all a fiction you didnt think id really come and see you did you this place is disgusting does this mean you dont want my help look i couldnt jeopardize my position with the grandmaster it took me time to win his trust hes a lunatic but he can be amenable what im telling you is you could join me at the grandmasters side perhaps in time an accident befalls the grandmaster and then youre not seriously thinking of going back are you our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass shes stronger than both of us shes stronger than you you dont stand a chance do you understand what im saying here fine i guess ill just have to go it alone like ive always done would you say something say something what would you like me to say you faked your own death you stole the throne stripped odin of his power stranded him on earth to die releasing the goddess of death have i said enough or would you like me to go back further than the past two days you know i havent seen this beloved champion he talks of but ive heard he is astonishingly savage ive placed a large wager against you tomorrow dont let me down piss off ghost hes freaking gone yuck theres still someones hair and blood all over this guys can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight disgusting slobs thor wanna use a big wooden fork no yeah not really useful unless youre fighting off three vampires that were huddled together i really wish i had my hammer hammer quite unique it was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star and when i spun it really really fast it gave me the ability to fly you rode a hammer no i didnt ride the hammer the hammer rode you on your back no i used to spin it really fast and it would pull me off the oh my god a hammer pulled you off the ground it would pull me off the ground up into the air and i would fly every time i threw it it would always come back to me sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one thats a nice way of putting it i said theyre mine see her thats the one that put me in here yeah scrapper  gotta watch out for those asgardians man they are hard to perish asgardian hey hey hey do not zap me with that thing i just wanna talk asgard is in danger my god youre a valkyrie i used to wanna be a valkyrie when i was younger until i found out that you were all women theres nothing wrong with women of course i love women sometimes a little too much not in a creepy way just more of a respectful appreciation i think its great that there is an elite force of women warriors its about time are you done lord of thunder youre up please help me i need your help bye fine then you must be a traitor or a coward because the valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne listen closely your majesty this is sakaar not asgard and im a scrapper not a valkyrie bring him in for processing and no one escapes this place so youre gonna die anyway now dont you move my hands aint as

an alien planet its just a planet youve been on a planet before yeah one now youve been on two thats a good thing its a new experience my neurons theyre firing faster than my brain can handle the information the whole thing is totally different this time in the past i always felt like hulk and i each had a hand on the wheel but this time its like he had the keys to the car and i was locked in the trunk all right well youre back now thats all that matters no its not what matters what im trying to tell you is that if i turn into the hulk again banner may never come back and were stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out were not stranded im gonna figure out a way to get us home thank you not your home though asgard my home what listen my people are in great danger you and i we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister okay that is so wrong on so many i dont wanna fight your sister thats a family issue no shes an evil being i dont care what she is im not fighting any more beings im sick of it  what  i just told you if i turn into the hulk i am never gonna come back again and you dont care no no im putting together the team the hulk is the fire wait youre just using me to get to the hulk  what no  its gross you dont care about me youre not my friend no i dont even like the hulk hes all like smash smash smash i prefer you thanks but if im being honest when it comes to fighting evil beings he is very powerful and useful yeah banners powerful and useful too is he though how many phds does hulk have zero how many phds does banner have seven fine you dont have to fight anyone but were in danger here so we have to move what are you doing with that i need a disguise im a fugitive  i need a disguise  you are the disguise  ill be tony stark  what yeah tony and the gypsy no no youre not tony youre bruce bruce banner then why did you dress me up like tony because you were naked okay ill give you that what are you doing stop

its okay youre good calm down come on listen were gonna go to asgard and youre not gonna have to think about the hulk ever again all right all right this is bad banner banner banner banner thor hi hi i was gonna do that yeah well i did it first thats good what are you doing here what are you doing here i thought you were leaving i got sidetracked whats with the its my disguise but i can see your face not when i do this you cant your hair looks nice i like what you did with it change it washed it maybe what are those things on her eyes are those people that shes killed shes so beautiful and strong and courageous who is this guy  hes a friend  who me  im bruce  i feel like i know you i feel like i know you too look ive spent years in a haze trying to forget my past sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day i was thinking that you drink too much and that probably was gonna kill you i dont plan to stop drinking but i dont wanna forget i cant turn away anymore so if im gonna die well it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag  good  yeah so im saying that i wanna be on the team has it got a name yeah its called the revengers revengers because im getting revenge youre getting revenge do you want revenge im undecided okay also ive got a peace offering surprise just had to be sure hello bruce so last time i saw you you were trying to kill everybody where are you at these days it varies from moment to moment is that a dragonfang it is my god this is the famed sword of the valkyrie so sakaar and asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits refuel on xandar and we can be back in asgard in  months nope we are going through the big one the devils anus anus wait wait wait whose anus for the record i didnt know it was called that when i picked it that looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an einsteinrosen bridge we need another ship that will tear mine to pieces shes right we need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity and has an offline power steering system that could also function without the onboard computer and we need one with cup holders because were gonna die so drinks do i know you i feel like i know you i feel like i know you too its weird what do you say uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway talk about an adventure  we need a ship  need a ship there are one or two ships absolute top of the line models i dont mean to impose but the grandmaster has a great many ships i may even have stolen the access codes to his security system and suddenly youre overcome with an urge to do the right thing heavens no ive run out of favor with the grandmaster and in exchange for codes and access to a ship im asking for safe passage through the anus youre telling us that you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms yes brother i can okay can i just a quick fyi i was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us he did try to kill me yes me too on many many occasions there was one time when we were children he transformed himself into a snake and he knows that i love snakes so i went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like yeah its me and he stabbed me we were eight at the time if were boosting a ship were gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace why not set the beast loose shut up you guys have a beast no theres no beast hes just being stupid were going to start a revolution  revolution  ill explain later  whos this guy again  ill explain later is that some sort of protoplasm all the stuff thats coming out of you or are they eggs looks like eggs im looking for korg whos asking i know youre asking is there anyone else asking or is it just you the lord of thunder sends his best the revolution has begun revolution how did this happen dont know but the arenas mainframe for the obedience disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves i dont like that word which mainframe no why would i not like mainframe no the s word sorry the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves okay thats better hey so listen we should talk i disagree open communication was never our familys forte you have no idea been quite the revelation since we last spoke hello hi odin brought us together its almost poetic that his death should split us apart we might as well be strangers now two sons of the crown set adrift thought you didnt wanna talk about it heres the thing im probably better off staying here on sakaar thats exactly what i was thinking did you just agree with me come on this place is perfect for you its savage chaotic lawless brother youre gonna do great here do you truly think so little of me loki i thought the world of you i thought we were gonna fight side by side forever but at the end of the day youre you and im me i dont know maybe theres still good in you but lets be honest our paths diverged a long time ago yeah its probably for the best that we never see each other again its what you always wanted hey lets do get help  what  get help no  come on you love it  i hate it  its great it works every time  its humiliating  do you have a better plan  no were doing it we are not doing get help get help please my brother hes dying get help help him classic still hate it  its humiliating  not for me its not now which ones the ship she told us to get the commodore right though i feel it wont make much of a difference loki i know ive betrayed you many times before but this time its truly nothing personal the reward for your capture will set me up nicely never one for sentiment were you easier to let it burn i agree that looks painful dear brother youre becoming predictable i trust you you betray me round and round in circles we go see loki life is about its about growth its about change but you seem to just wanna stay the same i guess what im trying to say is that youll always be the god of mischief but you could be more ill just put this over here for you anyway all got places to be so good luck all right i can figure this out its just another spaceship loyal sakaarians lord of thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion sakaarians take to the skies bring him down do not let him leave this planet  good shot  thanks open the doors okay i hope that youre tougher than you look why shouldnt we be shooting back or something yes we should where are the guns on this ship there arent any  its a leisure vessel  what grandmaster uses it for his good times orgies and stuff did she just say the grandmaster uses it for orgies yeah dont touch anything no  no  no get inside in a minute i should probably go and help here take the wheel no i dont know how to fly one of these youre a scientist use one of your phds none of them are for flying alien spaceships okay come on theres gotta be a gun on this thing that looks like a gun its my birthday its my birthday its my birthday yeah guys were coming up on the devils anus there she is our ticket out of here hey whats this thank you hey man were about to jump on that ginormous spaceship you wanna come you do seem like youre in desperate need of leadership why thank you here we go shit asgardians some misguided soul has stolen the bifrost sword tell us where it is or there will be consequences bad ones well you well executioner wait wait i know where the sword is i never thought id be back here i thought itd be a lot nicer i mean not that its not nice its just its on fire here up here in the mountains heat signatures people clustered together shes coming for them okay drop me off at the palace and ill draw her away and get yourself killed the people trapped down there are all that matters while im dealing with hela i need you two to help get everyone off asgard how the hell are we supposed to do that i have a man on the ground asgard shes here now the ship has a gun ill take it from here i found this in the armory good luck your majesty dont die you know what i mean we must keep moving go to the bifrost sister youre still alive i love what youve done with the place redecorating i see it seems our fathers solution to every problem was to cover it up or to cast it out he told you you were worthy he said the same thing to me you see you never knew him not at his best odin and i drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears where do you think all this gold came from and then one day he decided to become a benevolent king to foster peace to protect life to have you i understand why youre angry and you are my sister and technically have a claim to the throne and believe me i would love for someone else to rule but it cant be you youre just the worst okay get up youre in my seat you know father once told me that a wise king never seeks out war but must always be ready for it go back go to be honest i expected more heimdall the sword heres the difference between us im odins firstborn the rightful heir the savior of asgard and youre nothing so simple even a blind man could see it now you remind me of dad the stupid dog wont die everythings gonna be all right now i got this you wanted to know who i am what the hell are you talking about youll see you see no ones going anywhere ill get that sword even if i have to kill every single one of them to do it hey man im korg this is miek were gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here wanna come

that hank pym good morning hank hope would it kill you to call me dad dr cross will be so pleased that you could find the time to join us today more like thrilled i was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you darren whats the occasion oh youll see wont he hope were ready for you inside ouch i guess some old wounds never heal huh dont worry shes in good hands youre in for a treat long time no see dr pym hows retirement hows your face after you now before we start id like to introduce a very special guest this companys founder and my mentor dr hank pym when i took over this company for dr pym i immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of hanks research i couldnt tell you but just imagine a soldier the size of an insect the ultimate secret weapon an antman thats what they called you right hank silly i know propaganda tales to astonish trumpedup bs to scare the ussr hank will you tell our guests what you told me every single time i asked you was the antman real just a tall tale right because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real well i was inspired by the legend of the antman and with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material i thought could it be possible to shrink a person could that be done well its not a legend anymore distinguished guests i am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it the yellowjacket oh no the yellowjacket is an allpurpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage we live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance its time to return to a simpler age one where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests an allpurpose peacekeeping vessel the yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the geopolitical landscape completely unseen efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault practical applications include surveillance industrial sabotage and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace a single yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon an army of yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of wellbeing around the world the yellowjacket so its a suit dont be crude frank its not a suit its a vessel whats the matter youre not impressed no im impressed im also concerned imagine what our enemies could do with this tech we should have a longer conversation about that frank i really value your opinion thank you for coming hope thank you very much everybody i will escort you out now thank you you seem a bit shocked darren theres a reason that i buried these secrets so you finally admit it we could have done this together hank but you ruined that thats why youre the past and im the future dont do this dr cross you sell to me first  over your asking price i can have the cash here in two weeks deal we have to make our move hank how close is he he still cant shrink a live subject just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all no i have cross complete trust  its too dangerous  we dont have a choice well thats not entirely true i think i found a guy who daddy peanut oh happy birthday im so sorry im late

frank yeah well uh unfortunately we cant just do whatever we want itd be nice though right but there are laws what laws of man the laws of nature transcend the laws of man and ive transcended the laws of nature darren i dont think you understand hmm we still havent worked out all the bugs goodbye frank thank you you know ive been thinking a lot about gratitude lately and today during my morning meditation an interesting thought occurred to me and i think it might apply to you too hows that gratitude can be forgiveness ive spent years carrying around my anger for hank pym i devoted my genius to him i could have worked anywhere i chose my mentor poorly you didnt even have a choice he never believed in you its a shame what we had to do but he forced us to do it didnt he but we shouldnt be angry we should be grateful because his failures as a mentor as a father forced us to spread our wings youre a success darren you deserve everything coming your way ooh stop cheating hey whats up hotshot maybe he didnt hear you how was the party  tell me about that tip  what i wanna know about that tip oh baby its on its so on right now calm down all right i just need to know where it came from its gotta be airtight okay i was at a wine tasting with my cousin ernesto which was mainly reds and you know i dont like reds man but there was a rosé that saved the day it was delightful and then he tells me about this girl emily that we used to kick it with it was actually the first pair of boobs i ever touched its the wrong details it has nothing to do with the story go so uh he tells me that shes working as a housekeeper now right and shes dating this dude carlos whos a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that shes cleaning for right that hes like this bigshot ceo that is all retired now but hes loaded and so carlos and ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking right and here comes the good part carlos says yo man this guys got a bigass safe just sitting in the basement just chilling of course ernesto comes to me because he knows i got mad thieving skills of course i ask him did emily tell carlos to tell you to get to me what

theres no cash no jewelry nothing no its a bust im really sorry scotty i know you needed to score i thought we were using mice whats the difference commence experiment c organic atomic reduction darren maybe we should think shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology i cant go to the buyers with half a breakthrough experiment c results negative sanitize the work station bring in subject c why would you lock this up this is so weird scotty whats up man i wonder what is this the world sure seems different from down here doesnt it scott what who said that luis down here its a trial by fire scott or in this case water guess youre tougher than you thought oh i dont want to see this luis son of a what the hell not bad for a test drive keep the suit ill be in touch no no no thank you get down on the ground you are under arrest no i didnt steal anything i was returning something i stole oh dont move you know you almost had us convinced that you were gonna change your ways they were really rooting for you its gonna break their hearts  you got a visitor  who your lawyer my lawyer i told you id be in touch scott im starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell oh man sit down sir im sorry i stole the suit i dont even wanna know why you have it maggie was right about you how do you know about no wonder shes trying to keep you away from cassie the moment things get hard you turn right back to crime the way i see it you have a choice you can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions i dont understand no i dont expect you to but you dont have many options right now and quite frankly neither do i why do you think i let you steal that suit in the first place what second chances dont come around all that much so next time you think you might see one i suggest you take a real close look at it youre my bestest friend are you sure you dont want a different toy no i love this one okay well get some sleep i love you  mommy  hmm is daddy a bad man i heard some grownups say hes bad no daddy just gets confused sometimes you know smart choice you actually listened for once under the door okay where to now  hang tight  oh god what what where the hell did he go i have no idea he just vanished set up a fiveblock perimeter now get back get back scott these are my associates is that a camera on an ant yeah sure why not wheres the car no car weve got wings incoming put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax  how safe is  just get on the damn ant scott why am i on a police car shouldnt i not be on a police car so they can give you a lift past their fiveblock perimeter all right  now whats the next move  hang on tight oh this is easy im getting the hang of this yank up to go up its like a horse youre throwing  off balance wait his name is  he doesnt have a name he has a number scott do you have any idea how many ants there are whoa maybe its maybe its  no no vertigo vertigo  no i think its   wait hang on tight i think im getting the hang of this i am controlling  he is not listening to you what  can i make one little request  no stop  time out time out time out all right hold on just wait whoa what happens if i throw up in this helmet its my helmet scott you do not throw up lets set her down all right im getting lightheaded hang on scott im getting a little light i need a snooze button hit me in  minutes hello who are you have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time yes why because the last time you were here you stole something oh oh hey look whoa paraponera clavata giant tropical bullet ants ranked highest on the schmidt pain index theyre here to keep an eye on you when i cant dr pyms waiting for you downstairs who hey um whose pajamas are these how am i supposed to do this all right just one step at a time ugh you dont bite me i dont step on you deal i could take down the servers and cross wouldnt even know it we dont need this guy i assume that youve already met my daughter hope i did shes great she doesnt think that we need you we dont we can do this ourselves i go to all this effort to let you steal my suit and then hope has you arrested okay we can try this and when he fails ill do it myself shes a little bit anxious it has to do with this job which judging by the fact that youre sitting opposite me i take it that youre interested in what job would you like some tea uh sure i was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system freezing that metal was particularly clever were you watching me scott ive been watching you for a while ever since you robbed vista corp oh excuse me burgled vista corp vistas security system was one of the most advanced in the business it was supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it would you like some sugar yeah thanks you know what im okay how do you make them do that ants can lift objects  times their weight they build farm they cooperate with each other right but how do you make them do that i use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center i speak to them i can go anywhere hear anything and see everything and still know absolutely nothing im late to meet cross uh dr pym you dont need to raise your hand scott sorry i just have one question who are you who is she what the hells going on and can i go back to jail now come with me  years ago i created a formula that altered atomic relative distance huh i learned how to change the distance between atoms thats what powers the suit thats why it works wow  whoa  but it was dangerous it was too dangerous so i hid it from the world and thats when i switched gears and i started my own company pym tech yes i took on a young protégé called darren cross darren cross hes a big deal but before he was a big deal he was my assistant i thought i saw something in him the son i never had perhaps he was brilliant but as we became close he began to suspect that i wasnt telling him everything he heard rumors about what was called the pym particle and he became obsessed with recreating my formula but i wouldnt help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company how could he do that the boards chairman is my daughter hope she was the deciding vote but she came back to me when she saw how close cross was to cracking my formula the process is highly volatile if one isnt protected by a specialized helmet it can affect the brains chemistry i dont think darren realizes this and you know hes not the most stable guy to begin with so what do you want from me scott i believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption do you i do if you can help me i promise i can help you be with your daughter again now are you ready to redeem yourself absolutely my days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done what do you want me to do i want you to break into a place and steal some shit are you gonna be home for dinner tonight uh yeah ill pick something up text me okay good news uh i dont know its news are you trying to find my daddy yeah i am sweetheart i just want your daddy to be safe hope you dont catch him this isnt the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on gamechanging weaponry thats mitchell carson exhead of defense at shield presently in the business of toppling governments he always wanted my tech and now unless we break in and steal the yellowjacket and destroy all the data darren cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world i think our first move should be calling the avengers i spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a stark im sure as hell not gonna handdeliver it to one now this is not some cute technology like the iron man suit this could change the texture of reality besides theyre probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky okay then why dont you just send the ants scott they are ants ants they can do a lot of things but they still need a leader somebody that could infiltrate a place thats designed to prevent infiltration hank im a thief all right i mean im a good thief but this is insane hes right hank and you know it youve seen the footage you know what cross is capable of i was against using him when we had months and now we have days im wearing the suit absolutely not i know the facility inside and out i know how cross thinks i know this mission better than anybody here we need you close to cross otherwise this mission cannot work  we dont have time to screw around  hope please listen to me he is a criminal im your daughter no shes right hank im not your guy why dont you wear the suit you think i dont want to i cant i spent years wearing it and it took a toll on me youre our only option before hope lost her mother she used to look at me like i was the greatest man in the world and now she looks at me and theres just disappointment its too late for me but not for you this is your chance the chance to earn that look in your daughters eyes to become the hero that she already thinks you are its not about saving our world its about saving theirs damn that was a good speech scott i need you to be the antman in the right hands the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic the suit has power the man harnesses that power you need to be skillful agile and above all you need to be fast you should be able to shrink and grow on a dime so your size always suits your needs now dive through the keyhole scott you charge big you dive small then you emerge big ow ahhh ow useless when youre small energys compressed so you have the force of a pound man behind a fist a th of an inch wide youre like a bullet you punch too hard you kill someone too soft its a love tap in other words you have to know how to punch i was in prison for three years i know how to punch show me  terrible  you wanna show me how to punch show me thats how you punch  shes been looking forward to this  no kidding hope trained in martial arts at a difficult time oh by difficult time he means when my mother died we lost her in a plane crash its bad enough you wont tell me how she died could you please stop telling me that lie were working here all right princess lets get back to work were you going for the hand you know i think this regulator is holding me back do not screw with the regulator if that regulator is compromised you would go subatomic what does that mean it means that you would enter a quantum realm what does that mean it means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity everything that you know and love gone forever cool yeah if it aint broke youve learned about the suit but youve yet to learn about your greatest allies the ants loyal brave and your partners on this job paratrechina longicornis commonly known as crazy ants theyre lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics youre not so crazy hey youre cute that was a lot scarier a second ago it looks like the futures lab has its own isolated power supply theres a security guard posted around the clock well need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems okay whos next paraponera clavata i know bullet ants right number  on the schmidt pain index hey guys remember me from the bedroom the yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about  millimeters in diameter why do i have a sick feeling in my stomach the tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for  seconds youre gonna need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers retrieve the suit and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on camponotus pennsylvanicus alternatively known as a carpenter ant ideal for ground and air transport wait a minute i know this guy im gonna call him antthony thats good thats very good because this time youre really gonna have to learn how to control him tell them to put the sugar in the teacup aw you okay did i hurt hank wants you outside for target practice the suit has no weapons so i made you these discs red shrinks blue enlarges solenopsis mandibularis known for their bite the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects they are handy to get you in and out of difficult places you can do it scott come on theyre not listening to me you have to commit you have to mean it no shortcuts no lies throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good hope we dont have time for coddling our focus should be on helping scott really is that where our focus should be hope i dont know why i came to you in the first place we cant do this without her oh god you gotta lock your doors i mean really theres some weird folks in this neighborhood do you think this is a joke do you have any idea what hes asking you to risk you have a daughter im doing this for her you know when my mother died i didnt see him for two weeks he was in grief yeah so was i and i was seven and he never came back not in any way that counted he just sent me off to boarding school you know i thought with all thats at stake just maybe we might have a chance of making peace but even now he still wants to shut me out he doesnt wanna shut you out he trusts you then why are you here it proves that he loves you hope look at me im expendable thats why im here you must have realized that by now i mean its why im in the suit and youre not he would rather lose this fight than lose you anyway you know i didnt know you had a daughter when i called the cops on you whats her name cassie its a pretty name you have to clear your mind scott you have to make your thoughts precise thats how it works think about cassie about how badly you want to see her and use that to focus open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do thats good your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions they called her the wasp she was born to it and theres not a day that goes by that i dont regret having said yes it was  separatists had hijacked a soviet missile silo in kursk and launched an icbm at the united states the only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium i knew i had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile but my regulator had sustained too much damage your mother she didnt hesitate janet no she turned off her regulator and went subatomic to deactivate the bomb and she was gone your mom died a hero and i spent the next  years trying to learn all i could about the quantum realm you were trying to bring her back but all i learned was we know nothing its not your fault she made her choice but why didnt you tell me that sooner i was trying to protect you i lost your mother i didnt mean to lose you too im sorry this is awesome its awesome you know you guys are breaking down walls youre healing its important i ruined the moment didnt i yes you did yes im going to make some tea nailed it thats a good boy antthony the final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion its freezing you couldnt make a suit with a flannel lining you must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy its a device that i invented during my shield days we need it to counteract the transmission blockers that cross installed in the futures vault its currently collecting dust in one of howard starks old storage facilities in upstate new york should be a piece of cake youre over the target area disengage now scott squadron a go b go c go all right antthony please dont drop me this time oh it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this stay calm guys we might have a problem hank didnt you say this was some old warehouse its not you son of a bitch  scott get out of there  abort abort now no its okay it doesnt look like anyones home antthony get me to the roof hes gonna lose the suit hes gonna lose his life all right im on the roof of the target building somebodys home scott whats going on down there sam its the falcon i had a sensor trip but im not seeing anything wait a second abort scott abort now its okay he cant see me i can see you he can see me hi im scott did he just say hi im scott  what are you doing here  first off im a big fan appreciate it so who the hell are you im antman antman what you havent heard of me no you wouldnt have heard of me you wanna tell me what you want i was hoping i could grab a piece of technology just for a few days im gonna return it i need it to save the world you know how that is i know exactly how that is located the breach  bringing him in  sorry about this what the hell are you doing breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech sorry look im sorry about this sorry thats enough antthony a little help ive lost visual hes inside my pack sorry you seem like a really great guy its really important to me that cap never finds out about this that was completely irresponsible and dangerous you jeopardized everything you got it well done wait a minute did you just compliment me  he did didnt he  kind of sounded like he did i was good wasnt i hey how about the fact that i fought an avenger and didnt die let us not dwell on the past we gotta finish our planning dont mind him you did good darren how the hell did you get in here you left the front door open hank its official youre old the plans he will kill him well to what do i owe this pleasure i have good news really whats that pym tech the company you created is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world were anticipating  billion in sales tomorrow alone youre welcome i know this is odd but id like you to be there this is my moment i want you to see it sure darren yeah sure ill be there what did you see in me i dont know what you mean all those years ago you picked me what did you see i saw myself then why did you push me away because i saw too much of myself he knows hes baiting you we have to call it off were all taking risks what if he saw me here he didnt theres no way how do you know that darren hi hope where are you right now im at home why i just saw hank i still get nothing but contempt from him dont let him rile you up hes just a senile old man we need to start everyone working around the clock get the assembly line up and running and im tripling security full sensors at all entrances and exterior air vents fitted with steel micromesh great good idea thank you hope im so lucky to have you on my team hes tripling security hes lost his mind and hes onto you but he is not onto you hes adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents how are we gonna get scott inside the water main you cant add security to a water main the pressure is too strong but if we can decrease it thats how i get in somebody would have to reach the buildings control center to change the water pressure hank and i will be beside cross how are we supposed to do that so we expand our team what do we need a fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system somebody else to hack in to the power supply and kill the laser grid and a getaway guy no no no no no not those three wombats no way thank you for the coffee maam its not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back because we just robbed you you know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine right two smoothie machines are you sure they can handle this oh we can handle it were professionals youll forgive us if were not instilled with confidence well hey everybody just kick back and relax a little bit man we know our business we broke into this spookyass house didnt we i let you well one could say that i let you let me  look its

suit to them they fell right asleep hey look i wanna thank you for no please dont were all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us im just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off hey thank you you know for that pep talk you know the honest truth is i actually went from despising you to almost liking you you really should write poetry get some sleep scott

kind of guy hank he escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how and then he disappears magically despite having no money to his name and now he brings me the antman suit the only thing that can rival my creation darren dont do this if you sell to these men its gonna be chaos i already have and for twice the price thanks to you its not easy to successfully infiltrate an avengers facility thankfully word travels fast ill sell them the yellowjacket but im keeping the particle to myself they dont run on diesel if you want the fuel youll have to come to me what do you call the

right to me we have to run doctor west what are you doing hey organ harvest hes a donor slow down i did not agree to that i dont need you to weve already called brain death prematurely we need to get him prepped for suboccipital craniotomy not gonna let you operate on a dead man what do you see  a bullet  a perfect bullet its been hardened you harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony a toxic metal and thats leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid rapid onset central nervous system shutdown we gotta go the patients not dead but he is dying still want to harvest his organs  ill assist you  no doctor palmer will assist me thank you image guidance stat we dont have time for that you cant do it freehand i can and i will this isnt a time for showing off strange how about

pull the files from the archive but if it proves your arrogant ass wrong worth it i looked at all your research i read all the papers youve sent its not gonna work i dont think you realize  how severe the damages are  heres the thing the best have tried and failed i understand heres the thing what you want from me is impossible stephen come on ive got my own reputation to consider  etienne wait no  i cant help you no no wait hey he wont do it hes a hack there is a new procedure in tokyo they culture donor stem cells and then harvesting them and then d printing a scaffold if i could get a loan together stephen a small loan just  youve always spent money as fast as you could make it but now youre spending money you dont even have maybe its time to consider stopping no now is exactly the time not to stop because you see im not getting any better but this isnt medicine anymore this is mania some things just cant be fixed  life without my work  ls still life this isnt the end there are other things that can give your life meaning like what like you this is the part where you apologize this is the part where you leave fine i cant watch you do this to yourself anymore oh too difficult for you is it yes it is it breaks my heart to see you this way  no dont pity me  im not pitying you oh yeah then what are you doing here bringing cheese and wine like were old friends going for a picnic we are not friends christine we were barely lovers but you just love a sob story dont you is that what i am to you now poor stephen strange charity case he finally needs me another dreg of humanity for you to work on patch him up and send him back into the world hearts just humming you care so much dont you goodbye stephen all the way here we go lets go all day all day yeah all day come on man wheres the competition talk a lot jonathan pangborn cc spinal cord injury complete who are you paralyzed from the midchest down partial paralysis in both hands  i dont know you  im stephen strange im a neurosurgeon was a neurosurgeon actually you know what man i do know you i came to your office once you refused to see me i never got past your assistant you were untreatable no glory for you in that right you came back from a place theres no way back from im trying to find my own way back pangborn are you in or you out all right id given up on my body i thought my minds the only thing i have left i should at least try to elevate that so i sat with gurus and sacred women strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men and finally i found my teacher and my mind was elevated and my spirit deepened and somehow your body healed yes there were deeper secrets to learn there but i didnt have the strength to receive them i chose to settle for my miracle and i came back home the place youre looking for is called kamartaj but the cost there is high how much im not talking about money good luck lets ball all right ball up uh kamartaj you know where kamartaj is kamartaj kamartaj okay look guys i dont have any money your watch no please its all i have left your watch all right youre looking for kamartaj really sure we got the right place that one looks a little more kamartajey i once stood in your place and i too was disrespectful so might i offer you some advice forget everything you think you know all right the sanctuary of our teacher the ancient one the ancient one whats his real name right forget everything i think i know sorry um thank you for whoa okay thats a thing thank you for hello oh thank you and thank you uh thank you ancient one for seeing me youre very welcome the ancient one thank you master mordo thank you master hamir mr strange uh doctor actually well no not anymore surely isnt that why youre here youve undergone many procedures  seven right  yeah its good tea yes did you heal a man named pangborn a paralyzed man in a way you helped him to walk again yes how did you correct a complete cc spinal cord injury well i didnt correct it he couldnt walk i convinced him that he could youre not suggesting it was psychosomatic when you reattach a severed nerve is it you who heals it back together or the body its the cells the cells are only programmed to put themselves back together in very specific ways right what if i told you that your own body could be convinced to put itself back together in all sorts of ways youre talking about cellular regeneration thats bleeding edge medical tech is that why youre working here without a governing medical board just how experimental is your treatment quite so youve figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to selfheal no mr strange i know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body  the spirit to heal the body  thats right no all right how do we do that where do we start  dont like that map  oh no its really good its just ive seen it before in gift shops and what about this one  acupuncture great  yeah what about that one showing me an mri scan i do not believe this each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part but not the whole i spent my last dollar getting here oneway ticket and youre talking to me about healing through belief youre a man looking at the world through a keyhole youve spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole to see more to know more now on hearing that it can be widened in ways you cant imagine you reject the possibility no i reject it because i do not believe in fairy tales about chakras or energy or the power of belief there is no such thing as spirit we are made of matter and nothing more youre just another tiny momentary speck within an indifferent universe you think too little of yourself oh you think you see through me do you well you dont but i see through you what did you just do to me i pushed your astral form out of your physical form whats in that tea psilocybin lsd its just tea with a little honey what just happened for a moment you entered the astral dimension the what a place where the soul exists apart from the body why are you doing this to me to show you just how much you dont know open your eye oh shit oh god oh god no no no no whats happening this isnt real his heart rate is getting dangerously high he looks all right to me you think you know how the world works you think that this material universe is all there is what is real what mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses at the root of existence mind and matter meet thoughts shape reality on this universe is only one of an infinite number worlds without end some benevolent and life giving others filled with malice and hunger dark places where powers older than time lie ravenous and waiting who are you in this vast multiverse mr strange have you seen that before in a gift shop teach me no no no no no no no open the door please thank you masters you think i was wrong to cast him out  hours later hes still on your doorstep theres a strength to him stubbornness arrogance ambition ive seen it all before he reminds you of kaecilius i cannot lead another gifted student to power only to lose him to the darkness you didnt lose me i wanted the power to defeat my enemies you gave me the power to defeat my demons and to live within the natural law we never lose our demons mordo we only learn to live above them kaecilius still has the stolen pages if he deciphers them he could bring ruin upon us all there may be dark days ahead perhaps kamartaj could use a man like strange dont shut me out i havent got anywhere else to go thank you bathe rest meditate if you can the ancient one will send for you whats this my mantra the wifi password were not savages the language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization the sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language spells but if that word offends your modern sensibilities you can call it a program the source code that shapes reality we harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse to cast spells to conjure shields and weapons to make magic but even if my fingers could do that my hands would just be waving in the air how do i get from here to there how did you get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone study and practice years of it hey mr strange uh stephen please  and you are  wong wong just wong like adele or aristotle drake bono eminem the book of the invisible sun astronomia nova codex imperium key of solomon you finished all of these yup come with me all right this section is for masters only but at my discretion others may use it you should start with maxims primer hows your sanskrit im fluent in google translate vedic classical sanskrit what are those the ancient ones private collection so theyre forbidden no knowledge in kamartaj is forbidden only certain practices those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the sorcerer supreme this ones got pages missing thats the book of cagliostro a study of time one of the rituals was stolen by a former master the zealot kaecilius just after he strung up the former librarian and relieved him of his head i am now the guardian of these books so if a volume from this collection should be stolen again id know it and youd be dead before you ever left the compound what if its just overdue any late fees i should know about maiming perhaps people used to think that i was funny did they work for you all right well its been lovely talking to you thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and for the threat upon my life we will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us the one who betrays the world mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts they allow us to travel throughout the multiverse all you need to do is focus visualize see the destination in your mind look beyond the world in front of you imagine every detail the clearer the picture the quicker and easier the gateway will come and stop i would like a moment alone with mr strange of course my hands its not about your hands how is this not about my hands master hamir thank you master hamir you cannot beat a river into submission you have to surrender to its current and use its power as your own i control it by surrendering control that doesnt make any sense not everything does not everything has to your intellect has taken you far in life but it will take you no further surrender stephen silence your ego and your power will rise come with me wait  is this  everest beautiful yeah right beautiful freezing but beautiful at this temperature a person can last for  minutes before suffering permanent loss of function great but youll likely go into shock within the first two  what  surrender stephen no hows our new recruit we shall see any second now oh no not again maybe i should stephen wong what do you want strange books on astral projection youre not ready for that try me beyoncé oh come on youve heard of her shes a huge star right do you ever laugh oh come on  just give me the book no once in this room you begged me to let you learn now im told you question every lesson preferring to teach yourself once in this room you told me to open my eye now im being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library wong told on me youre advancing quickly with your sorcery skills you need a safe space to practice your spells you are now inside the mirror dimension ever present but undetected the real world isnt affected by what happens here we use the mirror dimension to train surveil and sometimes to contain threats you dont wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring hold on sorry what do you mean threats learning of an infinite multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers if i told you everything else that you dont already know youd run from here in terror so just how ancient is she no one knows the age of the sorcerer supreme only that shes celtic and never talks about her past you follow her even though you dont know i know shes steadfast but unpredictable merciless yet kind she made me what i am trust your teacher and dont lose your way like kaecilius thats right you knew him when he first came to us hed lost everyone he ever loved he was a grieving broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts a brilliant student but he was proud headstrong he questioned the ancient one rejected her teaching he left kamartaj his disciples followed him like sheep seduced by false doctrine and he stole the forbidden ritual right yes what did it do no more questions whats that thats a question this is a relic some magic is too powerful to sustain so we imbue objects with it allowing them to take the strain we cannot this is the staff of the living tribunal there are many relics the wand of watoomb the vaulting boots of valtorr really just roll off the tongue dont they  when do i get my relic  when youre ready i think im ready youre ready when the relic decides youre ready for now conjure a weapon all right fight fight like your life depended on it because one day it may wong okay first open the eye of agamotto all right oh my what if dormammu the dark dimension eternal life  what the  stop tampering with continuum probabilities is forbidden i was just doing exactly what it said in the book what did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual i dont know i hadnt gotten to that part yet temporal manipulations can create branches in time unstable dimensional openings spatial paradoxes time loops you wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over and over forever or never having existed at all really should put the warnings before the spell your curiosity could have gotten you killed you werent manipulating the spacetime continuum you were breaking it we do not tamper with natural law we defend it how did you even do that hmm where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it ive got a photographic memory thats how i got my md and phd at the same time what you just did takes more than a good memory you were born for the mystic arts and yet my hands still shake for now yes not forever were not prophets when are you gonna start telling me what we are while heroes like the avengers protect the world from physical dangers we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats the ancient one is the latest in a long line of sorcerers supreme going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts the mighty agamotto same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed agamotto built three sanctums in places of power where great cities now stand that door leads to the hong kong sanctum that door to the new york sanctum that one to the london sanctum together the sanctums generate a protective shield around our world the sanctums protect the world and we sorcerers protect the sanctums from what other dimensional beings that threaten our universe like dormammu where did you learn that name i just read it in the book of cagliostro why dormammu dwells in the dark dimension beyond time he is the cosmic conqueror the destroyer of worlds a being of infinite power and endless hunger on a quest to invade every universe and bring all worlds into his dark dimension and he hungers for earth most of all the pages that kaecilius stole a ritual to contact dormammu and draw power from the dark dimension uh okay um im out i came here to heal my hands not to fight in some mystical war london kaecilius no wong mordo hello hello daniel i see they made you master of this sanctum you know what that means that youll die protecting it stop how long have you been at kamartaj mister doctor mister doctor its strange maybe who am i to judge ha you dont know how to use that do you uh what oh stop it i said stop it you cannot stop this mister doctor i dont even know what this is its the end and the beginning the many becoming the few becoming the one if youre not gonna start making sense im just gonna to have to put this thing back on tell me mister doctor my name is doctor stephen strange  you are a doctor  yeah a scientist you understand the laws of nature all things age all things die in the end our sun burns out our universe grows cold and perishes but the dark dimension its a place beyond time thats it im putting this thing back on this world doesnt have to die doctor this world can take its rightful place alongside so many others as part of the one the great and beautiful one we can all live forever really what do you have to gain out of this new age dimensional utopia the same as you the same as everyone life eternal life people think in terms of good and evil when really time is the true enemy of us all time kills everything what about the people you killed tiny momentary specks within an indifferent universe yes you see you see what were doing the world is not what it ought to be humanity longs for the eternal for a world beyond time because time is what enslaves us time is an insult death is an insult doctor we dont seek to rule this world we seek to save it to hand it over to dormammu who is the intent of all evolution the why of all existence the sorcerer supreme defends existence what was it that brought you to kamartaj doctor was it enlightenment power you came to be healed as did we all kamartaj is a place that collects broken things we all come with the promise of being healed and instead the ancient one gives us parlor tricks the real magic she keeps for herself you ever wonder how she managed to live this long i saw the rituals in the book of cagliostro so you know the ritual gives me the power to overthrow the ancient one and tear her sanctums down to let the dark dimension in because what the ancient one hoards dormammu gives freely life everlasting hes not the destroyer of worlds doctor hes the savior of worlds no i mean come on look at your face dormammu made you a murderer just how good can his kingdom be you think thats funny no not that whats funny is that youve lost your sling ring sir can i help you doctor palmer where is she  sir we need to get  where is she the nurses station christine stephen oh my god get me in an operating theater now just you now i havent any time what happened i was stabbed cardiac tamponade what are you wearing chest cavity is clear no the blood is in the pericardial sac no no no stephen come on come on just a little higher please be careful with the needle stephen what am i seeing my astral body are you dead no christine but i am dying right yeah all right okay oh wow ive never seen a wound like this what were you stabbed with i dont know im gonna have to vanish now what keep me alive will you huh okay uhhuh oh shit come on come on stephen come on hit me again stop doing that up the voltage and hit me again no your hearts beating just do it oh my god oh god oh god are you okay yeah okay after all this time you just show up here flying out of your body yeah i know i missed you too by the way ha ha i wrote you emails but you never responded why would i christine i am so so sorry for all of it you were right i was a complete asshole i treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more stop youre clearly in shock what the hell is happening where have you been well after western medicine failed me i headed east and i ended up in kathmandu kathmandu yeah like the bob seger song  beautiful loser side a yeah i went to a place called kamartaj and i talked to someone called the ancient one oh so you joined a cult no i didnt no not exactly no they did teach me to tap into powers that i never even knew existed yeah that sounds like a cult its not a cult well thats what a cultist would say oh no wait stephen wait what do you think youre doing im late for a cult meeting this is insane yeah  where are you going  um can you tell me the truth well a powerful sorcerer who gave himself over to an ancient entity can bend the very laws of physics tried very hard to kill me but i left him chained up in greenwich village and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that i opened up in the mop closet okay dont tell me fine really do have to go yeah strange youre okay a relative term but yeah im okay the cloak of levitation it came to you no minor feat its a fickle thing  hes escaped  kaecilius yeah he can fold space and matter at will he folds matter outside the mirror dimension in the real world yeah  how many more  two i stranded one in the desert and the other his bodys in the hall master drumm is in the foyer hes been taken back to kamartaj the london sanctum has fallen only new york and hong kong remain now to shield us from the dark dimension you defended the new york sanctum from attack with its master gone it needs another master strange no it is doctor strange not master strange not mister strange doctor strange when i became a doctor i swore an oath to do no harm and i have just killed a man im not doing that again i became a doctor to save lives not take them you became a doctor to save one life above all others your own still seeing through me are you your overinflated ego you want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything even death which no one can control not even the great doctor stephen strange not even dormammu he offers immortality its our fear of death that gives dormammu life he feeds off it like you feed off him you talk to me about controlling death oh i know how you do it ive seen the missing rituals from the book of cagliostro measure your next words very carefully doctor because you might not like them because you may not know of what you speak what is he talking about im talking about her long life the source of her immortality she draws power from the dark dimension to stay alive thats not true ive seen the rituals worked them out i know how you do it once they regroup the zealots will be back youll need reinforcements shes not who you think she is you dont have the right to say that youve no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders no and i dont want to know youre a coward because im not a killer these zealots will snuff us all out and you cant muster the strength to snuff them first what do you think i just did you saved your own life and then whined about it like a wounded dog oh you would have done it so easily youve no idea the things ive done and the answer is yes without hesitation even if theres another way there is no other way you lack imagination no stephen you lack a spine theyre back we have to end this now strange get down here and fight no the mirror dimension you cant affect the real world in here whos laughing now asshole i am ive got his sling ring they cant escape right run their connection to the dark dimension makes them more powerful in the mirror dimension they cant affect the real world but they can still kill us this wasnt cleverness it was suicide that is hilarious this was a mistake whoa oh its true she does draw power from the dark dimension kaecilius i came to you broken lost in need trusted you to be my teacher and you fed me lies i tried to protect you  from the truth  from yourself i have a new teacher now dormammu deceives you you have no idea what he truly is his eternal life is not paradise but torment liar christine are you kidding me oh my god its not fibrillation she has a stunned myocardium  neurogenic  yes someone get the swabs nic we need to relieve the pressure on her brain shes still dropping were losing her we need to increase her oxygen i need a crash cart her pupils have dilated no reflexes were not reading any brain activity what are you doing come on youre dying you have to return to your body now you dont have time time is relative your body hasnt even hit the floor yet ive spent so many years peering through time looking at this exact moment but i cant see past it ive prevented countless terrible futures and after each one theres always another and they all lead here but never further you think this is where you die you wonder what i see in your future no yes i never saw your future only its possibilities you have such a capacity for goodness you always excelled but not because you craved success but because of your fear of failure thats what made me a great doctor its precisely what kept you from greatness arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all which is its not about you when you first came to me you asked me how i was able to heal jonathan pangborn i didnt he channels dimensional energy directly into his own body he uses magic to walk constantly he had a choice to return to his own life or to serve something greater than himself so i could have my hands back again my old life you could and the world would be all the lesser for it ive hated drawing power from the dark dimension but as you well know sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good mordo wont see it that way mordos soul is rigid and unmovable forged by the fires of his youth he needs your flexibility just as you need his strength only together do you stand a chance of stopping dormammu im not ready no one ever is we dont get to choose our time death is what gives life meaning to know your days are numbered your time is short youd think after all this time id be ready but look at me stretching one moment out into a thousand just so that i can watch the snow are you okay i dont understand whats happening i know but i have to go away now you said that losing my hands didnt have to be the end that it could be a beginning yeah because there are other ways to save lives a harder way a weirder way doctor palmer to the er please doctor palmer to the er i dont want you to go stop choose your weapon wisely no one steps foot in this sanctum no one kaecilius youre on the wrong side of history wong shes dead you were right she wasnt who i thought she was she was complicated complicated the dark dimension is volatile dangerous what if it overtook her she taught us it was forbidden while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life she did what she thought was right the bill comes due dont you see her transgressions led the zealots to dormammu kaecilius was her fault and here we are in the consequence of her deception a world on fire mordo the london sanctum has fallen the new york one has been attacked twice you know where theyre going next hong kong you told me once to fight like my life depended on it because one day it might well today is that day i cannot defeat them alone the sanctums already fallen the dark dimension dormammu is coming its too late nothing can stop him not necessarily no the spells working weve got a second chance whoa no wong breaking the laws of nature i know well dont stop now when the sanctums restored theyll attack it again weve got to defend it come on get up strange get up and fight we can finish this you cant fight the inevitable isnt it beautiful a world beyond time beyond death  beyond time  strange hes gone even strange has left you and surrendered to his power dormammu ive come to bargain youve come to die your world is now my world like all worlds dormammu ive come to bargain youve come to die your world is now my what is this illusion no this is real good dormammu ive come to bargain youve what is happening just as you gave kaecilius powers from your dimension i brought a little power from mine this is time endless looped time you dare oh dormammu ive come to bargain you cannot do this forever actually i can this is how things are now you and me trapped in this moment endlessly then you will spend eternity dying yes but everyone on earth will live but you will suffer pains an old friend dormammu ive come to bargain end this dormammu dormammu dormammu you will never win no but i can lose again and again and again and again forever and that makes you my prisoner no stop make this stop set me free no ive come to bargain what do you want take your zealots from the earth end your assault on my world never come back do it and ill break the loop get up strange get up and fight we can finish this isnt it beautiful a world beyond time beyond death what have you done i made a bargain what is this well its everything youve ever wanted eternal life as part of the one youre not gonna like it yeah you know you really should have stolen the whole book because the warnings the warnings come after the spells oh thats funny we did it yes yes we did it by also violating the natural law look around you its over you still think there will be no consequences strange no price to pay we broke our rules just like her the bill comes due always a reckoning i will follow this path no longer yeah okay wise choice youll wear the eye of agamotto once youve mastered its powers until then best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone a what you might have a gift for the mystic arts but you still have much to learn word of the ancient ones death will spread through the multiverse earth has no sorcerer supreme to defend it we must be ready well be ready thor so earth has wizards now huh tea i dont drink tea what do you drink not tea so i keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world your adopted brother loki is one of those beings worthy inclusion yeah so why bring him here to new york its a bit of a long story family drama that kind of thing but were looking for my father oh okay so if you found odin youd all return to asgard promptly oh yes promptly great allow me to help you can i help you they carried you into kamartaj on a stretcher look at you now pangborn mordo so what can i do for you man ive been away for many months now and ive had a revelation the true purpose of a sorcerer is to twist things out of their proper shape stealing power perverting nature like you ive stolen nothing this is my power  mine  power has a purpose why are you doing this because i see at long last whats wrong with the world too many sorcererstony a famous man once said we create our own demons who said that

frightening developments american airwaves were hijacked the nation remains on high alert all attempts to find the mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful ellis central to my administrations response to this terrorist event is a newly minted resource i know him as colonel james rhodes the american people will soon know him as the tron patriot and how is president ems responding by taking the guy they call war machine and giving him a paint job the same suit but painted red white and blue look at that and they also renamed him iron patriot you know just in case the paint was too subtle it tested well with focus groups all right gruffly i am iron patriot it sucks listen war machine was a little too aggressive all right this sends a better message sighs so whats really going on with the mandarin seriously can we talk about this guy its classified information tony okay there have been nine bombings  nine  the public only knows about three but heres the thing nobody can id a device

youre talking about but i like the way you say it my heart is yours meredith quill i cant believe i fell in love with a spaceman showtime aholes it will be here any minute which will be its loss i thought your thing was a sword weve been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries and im gonna stop it with a sword its just swords were your thing and guns were mine but i guess were both doing guns now i just didnt know that drax why arent you wearing one of rockets aerorigs it hurts it hurts i have sensitive nipples my nipples hurt oh goodness me what about him whats he doing im finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work how is that a priority blame quill hes the one who loves music so much no i actually agree with drax on this thats hardly important right now oh okay sure quill no seriously i side with drax no i understand that youre being very serious right now i can clearly see you winking damn it im using my left eye i am groot they were not looking at you funny well thats intense groot groot get out of the way youre gonna get hurt hi no spit it out come on disgusting the beasts hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside i must cut through it from the inside huh no no drax wait a minute drax what is he doing he said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside so he  that doesnt make any sense  i tried telling him that skin is the same level of thickness from the inside as from the outside i realize that there is a cut on its neck rocket get it to look up hey you giant seamonkey up here watch it quill yes i have singlehandedly vanquished the beast what what are they called again anulax batteries harbulary batteries thats nothing like what i just said but theyre worth thousands of units apiece which is why the sovereign hired us to protect them careful what you say around these folks theyre easily offended the cost of transgression is death we thank you guardians for putting your lives on the line we could not risk the lives of our own sovereign citizens every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community impeccable both physically and mentally we control the dna of our progeny germinating them in birthing pods i guess i prefer to make people the oldfashioned way perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors for academic purposes i would be honored yes in the name of research i think that could be pretty uh repulsive im not into that kind of casual oh please your people promised something in exchange for our services bring it and we shall gladly be on our way family reunion yay i understand she is your sister shes worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on xandar our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries do with her as you please we thank you high priestess ayesha what is your heritage mr quill my mother is from earth and your father he aint from missouri thats all i know i see it within you an unorthodox genealogy a hybrid that seems particularly reckless you know they told me you people were conceited douchebags but that isnt true at all oh shit im using my wrong eye again arent i im sorry that was meant to be behind your back count yourself blessed they didnt kill you youre telling me you wanna buy some batteries all right lets get baldy to xandar and collect that bounty that stuff about my father who does she think she is i know youre sensitive about that im not sensitive about it i just dont know who he is sorry if it seemed like i was flirting with the high priestess i wasnt i dont care if you were well i feel like you do care thats why im apologizing so sorry gamora is not the one for you quill damn shadow there are two types of beings in the universe those who dance and those who do not mmmhmm i first met my beloved at a war rally oh god everyone in the village flailed about dancing except one woman my ovette i knew immediately she was the one for me the most melodic song in the world could be playing she wouldnt even tap her foot wouldnt move a muscle one might assume she was dead that does sound pretty hot it would make my nether regions engorge okay i get it yes im a dancer gamora is not you just need to find a woman who is pathetic like you mmm im hungry hand me some of that yaro root no its not ripe yet and i hate you you hate me you left me there while you stole that stone for yourself and yet here you stand a hero i will be free of these shackles soon enough and i will kill you i swear no youre gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on xandar wishing you could this is weird weve got a sovereign fleet approaching from the rear why would they do that probably because rocket stole some of their batteries dude right he didnt steal some of those i dont know why theyre after us what a mystery this is what were you thinking dude they were really easy to steal  thats your defense  come on you saw how that high priestess talked down to us now im teaching her a lesson oh i didnt realize your motivation was altruism its really a shame the sovereign have mistaken your intentions  and theyre trying to kill us  exactly i was being sarcastic oh no youre supposed to use a sarcastic voice now i look foolish can we put the bickering on hold until after we survive this massive space battle  more incoming  good i wanna kill some guys youre not killing anyone all those ships are remotely piloted damn it what is the delay admiral high priestess the batteries they are exceptionally combustible and could destroy the entire fleet our concern is their slight against our people we hired them and they steal from us it is heresy of the highest order all command modules fire with the intent to kill whats the nearest habitable planet its called berhert  how many jumps  only one but the access point is  clicks away and you have to go through that quantum asteroid field quill to make it through that youd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe lucky for us i i am what are you doing ive been flying this rig since i was  years old i was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft you were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag stop it later on tonight youre gonna be laying down in your bed and theres gonna be something squishy in your pillow case and youre gonna be like whats this and its gonna

half of our ship my ship either one of you could have gotten us through that field had you flown with whats between your ears instead of whats between your legs if whats between my legs had a hand on it i guarantee i could have landed this ship with it peter we almost died because of your arrogance more like because he stole the anulax batteries theyre called harbulary batteries no theyre not do you know why i did it starmunch hmm im not gonna answer to starmunch i did it because i wanted to dick what are we even talking about this for we just had a little man save us by blowing up  ships how little well i dont know like this a little oneinch man saved us well if he got closer im sure he would be much larger thats how eyesight works you stupid raccoon dont call me a raccoon im sorry i took it too far i meant trash panda is that better i dont know its worse its so much worse you son of a hey  ive had it with you  no back up someone followed you through the jump point set me free youll need my help im not a fool nebula you are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat youll attack me the moment i let you go no i wont youd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly

want to know because it made you rich i demand a seat at the table i wear these flames same as you you may dress like us but youll never hear the horns of freedom when you die yondu and the colors of ogord will never flash over your grave if you think i take pleasure in exiling you youre wrong you broke all our hearts ah pathetic first quill betrays us and yondu just lets him go scotfree we followed him because he was the one who wasnt afraid to do what needed to be done seems hes goin soft if hes so soft why are you whispering you know im right kraglin you best be very careful what you say about our captain who the hell is that yondu udonta i have a proposition for you i hired yondu to pick you up when your mother passed away but instead of returning you yondu kept you i have no clue as to why well ill tell you why because i was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldnt it made it easier for thievin well ive been trying to track you down ever since i thought yondu was your father what weve been together this whole time and you thought yondu was my actual blood relative you look exactly alike ones blue no hes not my father yondu was the guy who

and all of a sudden  you wanna be my dad  i hear you and by the way this could be a trap the kree purists the ravagers  they all want us dead  i know but but what what was that story you told me about zardu hasselfrau who he owned a magic boat david hasselhoff right not a magic boat a talking car why did he talk again to help him fight crime and to be supportive as a child you would carry his picture in your pocket and you would tell all the other children that he was your father but that he was out of town shooting knight rider or touring with his band in germany i told you that when i was drunk why are you bringing that up now i love that story i hate that story its so sad as a kid i used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad and i wanted that more than anything in the world thats my point peter what if this man is your hasselhoff if he ends up being evil we will just kill him youre leaving me with that fox hes not a fox shoot her if she does anything suspicious  or if you feel like it  okay itll be just a couple of days well be back before rockets finished fixing the ship what if the sovereign come theres no way for them to know were here

and if you dont love me now you will never love me again i can still hear you saying you would never break the chain and if you dont love me now you will never love me again i can still hear you saying you would never break the chain hey can i ask you a personal question oh no one has ever asked me a personal question your antennae what are they for their purpose yes quill and i have a bet dude youre not supposed to say that i say if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low your antennae will feel this and keep you from being decapitated right and if its anything other than you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway i win they are not for feeling doorways i think they have something to do with my empathic abilities what are those if i touch someone i can feel their feelings  you read minds  no telepaths know thoughts empaths feel feelings emotions may i all right you feel love yeah i guess i feel a general unselfish love for just about everybody no romantic sexual love no i dont  for her  no okay she just told everyone your deepest darkest secret dude i think youre overreacting a little bit you must be so embarrassed do me do me i have never felt such humor so unbelievably uncool oh quill touch me and the only thing youre gonna feel is a broken jaw i can also alter emotions to some extent yeah like what if i touch someone who is sad i can ease them into contentment for a short while i can make a stubborn person compliant but i mostly use it to help my master sleep he lies awake at night thinking about his progeny do one of those on me

and i continued building from there layer by layer the very planet you walk on now whoa but i wanted more i desired meaning there must be some life out there in the universe besides just me i thought and so i set myself the task of finding it i created what i imagined biological life to be like down to the most minute detail did you make a penis dude what is wrong with you if he is a planet how could he make a baby with your mother he would smush her i dont need to hear how my parents why my father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice thats disgusting it was beautiful you earthers have hangups yes drax i got a penis ha thank you its not half bad  oh  ugh ive also got pain receptors and a digestive system and all the accompanying junk i wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as i set out amongst the stars until i found what i sought life i was not alone in the universe after all when did you meet my mother not long after it was with meredith that i first experienced love i called her my river lily and from that love peter you i have searched for you for so long and when i heard of a man from earth who held an infinity stone in his hand without dying i knew you must be the son of the woman i loved if you loved her why did you leave her this is mutiny this is mutiny youre scum oh captain help me please captain youre the one what killed those men by leading them down the wrong path because youre weak and stupid its time for the ravagers to rise once again to glory with a new captain taserface im sorry your name is its taserface thats right do you shoot tasers out of your face its metaphorical yeah for what for it is a name what strikes fear into the hearts of anyone what hears it okay okay whatever you say you shut up youre next udonta i have waited a long time to do what im sorry i am so sorry i just keep imagining you waking up in the morning sir looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself you know what would be a really kickass name taserface thats how i hear you in my head what was your second choice scrotum hat new plan were killing you first well dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life as a moronic shitbag who thinks taserface is a cool name thats enough killing for today shes the daughter of thanos i thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy that was when daddy was paying my bills the priestess wants to kill the fox herself and he has bounties on his head in at least  kree provinces i assure you i am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick or a talking woodland beast i want  of the take and a couple more things we got a whole box of hands  if that one dont work out  it is fine you think them kree is gonna execute the captain the kree consider themselves merciful it will be painless well here it is its the best ship we got location of egos planet in the nav well wire you the  once wes paid what are you gonna do with your share as a child my father would have gamora and me battle one another in training every time my sister prevailed my father would replace a piece of me with machinery claiming he wanted me to be her equal but she won again and again and again never once refraining so after i murder my sister i will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death i will hunt my father like a dog and i will tear him apart slowly piece by piece until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain i know every single day yeah i was talking about like a pretty necklace or a nice hat something to make the other girls go ooh thats nice anyways happy trails my mother told everyone my father was from the stars she had brain cancer so everyone thought she was delusional peter listen id love to believe all of this i really would but you left the most wonderful woman ever to die alone i didnt want to leave your mother peter if i dont return regularly to my planet and the light within it this form will wither and perish so why didnt you come back why did you send yondu a criminal of all people to come and fetch me i loved your mother peter i couldnt stand to set foot on an earth where she wasnt living you cant imagine what thats like i know exactly what that feels like i had to watch her die over the millions and millions of years of my existence ive made many mistakes peter but youre not one of them please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be theres so much that i need to teach you about this planet and the light within they are a part of you peter what do you mean give me your hands son here hold them like that now close your eyes and concentrate take your brain to the center of this planet yes whoa yes its okay just relax concentrate you can do it bring it back yes yes now shape it feel that energy yes youre home peter how did you get to this weird dumb planet ego found me in my larva state orphaned on my homeworld he raised me by hand and kept me as his own so youre a pet i suppose people usually want cute pets why would ego want such a hideous one i am hideous you are horrifying to look at yes but thats a good thing oh when youre ugly and someone loves you you know they love you for who you are beautiful people never know who to trust well then im certainly grateful to be ugly those pools they remind me of a time when i took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld she was like you disgusting innocent drax theres something i must tell you whats going on this gross bug lady is my new friend im learning many things like im a pet and ugly youre not ugly drax what are you talking about mantis can you show us where well be staying why are there no other beings on this planet the planet is ego a

groot  he hates hats i am groot on anyone not just himself i am groot one minute you think someone has a weirdshaped head the next minute its just because you realize part of that head is the hat

for a mammalian body to hop more than  jumps at a time i know that we are about to do  so i guess this could all be mine someday rocket rocket are you there what are you doing peter dance with me im not going to dance with you this is sam cooke one of the greatest earth singers of all time drax thinks youre not a dancer if you ever tell anyone about this i will kill you when are we gonna do something about this unspoken thing between us what unspoken thing this cheers sam and diane a guy and a girl on a tv show who dig each other but never say it because if they do the ratings would go down sort of thing theres no unspoken thing well its a catch because if you said it then it would be spoken and you would be a liar so by not saying it you are telling the truth and admitting that there is no thats not what i what we should be discussing right now is something about this place it doesnt feel right what are you talking about youre the one who wanted me to come here that girl mantis shes afraid of something why are you trying to take this away from me im not trying hes my father hes blood you have blood on earth and you never wanted to return there again you made me come here and earth is the place where my mother died in front of me no its because that place is real and this is a fantasy this is real im only half human remember thats the half im worried about oh i get it youre jealous because im partgod and you like when im the weak one you were insufferable to begin with i havent been able to reach rocket im gonna go outside and im gonna try and get a signal you know what this is not cheers after all this is whatever the show is where one person is willing to open themselves up to new possibility and the other person is a jerk who doesnt trust anybody its a show that doesnt exist thats why it would get zero ratings i dont know what cheers is i finally found my family dont you understand that i thought you already had damn it psychopath are you kidding me i win i win i bested you in combat no i saved your life well you were stupid enough to let me live you let me live i dont need you always trying to beat me im not the one that just flew across the universe just because i wanted to win do not tell me what i want i dont need to tell you what you want its obvious you were the one who wanted to win and i just wanted a sister you were all i had but you were the one who needed to win thanos pulled my eye from my head and my brain from my skull and my arm from my body because of you you all right son i saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff yeah its fortuitous you listening to this song  you know  brandy by looking glass a favorite of your moms yeah it was one of earths greatest musical compositions perhaps its very greatest yes peter you and i were the sailor in that song he came on a summers day bringing gifts from far away like the child i put in your mother or the freedom you brought gamora brandy youre a fine girl what a good wife you would be my life my love my lady is the sea the sea calls the sailor back he loves the girl but thats not his place the sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men and sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals well you may not be mortal but me no peter death will remain a stranger to both of us as long as the light burns within the planet im immortal mmmhmm really yes as long as the light exists and i can use the light to build cool things like how you made this whole planet it might take you a few million years of practice before you get really good at it but yes what get ready for an foot statue of pacman with skeletor and heather locklear you can do anything you want im gonna make some weird shit but you know peter it is a tremendous responsibility only we can remake the universe only we can take the bridle of the cosmos and lead it to where it needs to go how come with me drax drax drax drax we need to talk im sorry but i like a woman with some meat on her bones what i tried to let you down easily by telling you i found you disgusting no thats not what i what are you doing im imagining being with you physically drax i dont like you like that i dont even like the type of thing you are hey theres no need to get personal listen egos gotten exactly what he wanted i should have told you earlier im stupid you are in danger what is that now you need to readjust the way you process life everything around us including the girl everything is temporary we are forever doesnt eternity get boring not if you have a purpose peter which is why youre here i told you how all those years ago i had an unceasing impulse to find life but what i did not tell you was how when i finally did find it it was all so disappointing and that is when i came to a profound realization my innate desire to seek out other life was not so that i could walk among that life peter i have found meaning i see it eternity oh my god we need to get off this planet oh man anyway before i was so rudely interrupted at that time i was a federal express man what the hell you doing boy i could tell by how you talked about him this ego is bad news were here to save quill for what huh for honor for love no i dont care about those things i wanna save quill so i can prove im better than him i can lord this over him forever what are you laughing at me for you can fool yourself and everyone else but you cant fool me i know who you are you dont know anything about me loser i know everything about you i know you play like youre the meanest and the hardest but actually youre the most scared of all shut up i know you steal batteries you dont need and you push away anyone whos willing to put up with you because just a little bit of love reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is i said shut up i know them scientists what made you never gave a rats ass about you im serious dude just like my own damn parents who sold me their own little baby into slavery i know who you are boy because youre me what kind of a pair are we the kind thats about to go fight a planet i reckon all right okay good wait fight a what who are you people what is this place gamora let her go the bodies in the caverns who are they you are scared i call it the expansion it is my purpose and now it is yours as well its beautiful over thousands of years i implanted thousands of extensions of myself on thousands of worlds i need to fulfill lifes one true purpose to grow and spread covering all that exists until everything is me what did she do to me she already told me everything i only had one problem a single celestial doesnt have enough power for such an enterprise but two celestials well now that just might do the bodies are his children out of all my labors the most beguiling was attempting to graft my dna with that of another species i hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough to power the expansion i had yondu deliver some of them to me it broke the ravager code but i compensated him generously and to ease his conscience i said id never hurt them i mean that was true they never felt a thing but one after the other they failed me not one of them carried the celestial genes until you peter out of all my spawn only you carried the connection to the light we need to find peter now and get off this damn planet ego will have won him to his side by now  then we just go  no  hes our friend  all any of you do is yell at each other you are not friends youre right were family we leave no one behind except maybe you oh my god for the first time in my existence i am truly not alone what is it son my friends you see thats the mortal in you peter yes we are beyond such things yes  now  but my mother you said you loved my mother and that i did my river lily who knew all the words to every song that came over the radio i returned to earth to see her three times and i knew if i returned a fourth id never leave the expansion the reason for my very existence would be over so i did what i had to do but it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head what now all right i know that sounds bad who in the hell do you think you are you killed my mother i tried so hard to find the form that best suited you and this is the thanks i get you really need to grow up i wanted to do this together but i suppose youll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery finally rocket keep that transmitter nearby so i can find you were in an old piece of construction equipment yondu once used to slice open the bank of a askavaria egos unhinged i know get ready drop her kraglin no my life my love my lady is the sea peter this is the sea oh hey there jackass what is that thing out of the way dumber smaller groot i told you something didnt feel right i told you so just what i need to hear right now well i came back didnt i because theres an unspoken thing there is no unspoken thing what are you doing you couldve killed us all uh thank you rocket we had it under control we did not that is only an extension of his true self he will be back soon whats smurfette doing here whatever i need to do to get a damn ride home she tried to murder me i saved you you stupid fox hes not a fox  i am groot  im not a raboon either i am groot raccoon whatever how do we kill a celestial theres a center to him his brain his soul whatever it is some sort of protective shell its in the caverns below the surface yondu thrusters are out guess i should be glad i was a skinny kid otherwise youd have delivered me to this maniac you still reckon thats the reason i kept you around you idiot thats what you told me you old doofus once i figured out what happened to them other kids i wasnt just gonna hand you over you said you were gonna eat me that was being funny not to me you people have issues of course i have issues thats my freakin father thrusters are back up  we should be going up  we cant ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it we have to kill him rocket got it whoohoo so were saving the galaxy again i guess awesome were really gonna be able to jack up our prices if were twotime galaxy savers i seriously cant believe thats where your mind goes it was just a random thought man i thought we were friends of course i care about the planets and the buildings and all the animals on the planets and the people meh the crabby puppy is so cute he makes me wanna die pilots release envoy units our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet dive um captain captain tell me why ego wants you here he needs my genetic connection to the light to help destroy the universe he tried to teach me how to control the power so could you a little i made a ball a ball i thought as hard as i could it was all that i could come up with you thought you think when i make this arrow fly i use my head whoa there thats egos core that ore is thick rocket i got it covered we must hurry it will not take ego long to find us keep it steady we drill into the center we kill him captain what is it kraglin hey remember that ayesha chick  yeah why  uh oh hell why arent you firing the lasers they blew out the generator i think i packed a small detonator a detonator is worthless without explosives well we got these is that thing strong enough to kill ego if it is itll cause a chain reaction throughout his entire nervous system meaning what the entire planet will explode well have to get out of here fast i rigged a timer go hes coming didnt you say you could make him sleep when he wants hes too powerful i cant you dont have to believe in yourself because i believe in you sleep i never thought shed be able to do it with as weak and skinny as she appears to be i dont know how long i can hold him the metals too thick for the bomb to work wed actually need to place it on egos core and our fat butts aint gonna fit through those tiny holes well thats a terrible idea which is the only kind of idea we have left unbelievable rocket do this rocket do that what a day all right first you flick this switch then this switch that activates it then you push this button which will give you five minutes to get out of there now whatever you do dont push this button because that will set off the bomb immediately and well all be dead now repeat back what i just said  i am groot  uhhuh  i am groot  thats right  i am groot  no no thats the button that will kill everyone try again hmm  i am groot  mmmhmm  i am groot  uhhuh i am groot no thats exactly what you just said how is that even possible which button is the button youre supposed to push point to it no hey youre making him nervous shut up and get me some tape does anybody have any tape out there i wanna put some tape over the death button i dont have any tape let me check yo yondu ow do you have any tape gamora do you have any tape tape never mind ow drax do you have any tape yes scotch tape would work then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work if you dont have any nobody has any tape not a single person has tape nope did you ask nebula yes are you sure i asked yondu  and she was sitting next to him  i knew you were lying you have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag if anybodys gonna have tape its you thats exactly my point i have to do everything you are wasting a lot of time here whee were all gonna die rear thrusters are out again were done for without that generator guardians perhaps it will provide you solace that your deaths are not without purpose they will serve as a warning to all of those tempted with betraying us dont screw with the sovereign this is gonna hurt promises promises hey no no no no were gonna blow peter no what you look like mary poppins is he cool hell yeah hes cool im mary poppins yall mantis look out shes just unconscious how long until the bomb goes off in the unlikely event that groot doesnt kill us all about six minutes kraglin we need the quadrant for an extraction tminus five minutes aye captain somebodys gotta be up top when kraglin arrives drax take mantis ow my nipples gamora peter get over it come now peter i know this isnt what you want what kind of father would i be to let you make this choice yeah soon peter we will be all there is so stop pissing me off we have to get up to the extraction point go i told you i dont want to do this alone you cannot deny the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you everyone i need you to stay back what is that it doesnt need to be like this peter why are you destroying our chance stop pretending you arent what you are one in billions trillions even more what greater meaning can life possibly have to offer i dont use my head to fly the arrow boy i use my heart you shouldnt have killed my mom and squished my walkman and if you dont love me now you will never love me again i can still hear you saying you would never break the chain and if you dont love me now you will never love me again i can still hear you saying you would never break the chain and if you dont love me now you will never love me again i can still hear you saying you would never break the chain groot if you can hear me hurry up im not sure how long quill can keep him distracted groot hurry yondu were about to blow get to the ship not without quill you need to take care

whistle of one both yondu and david hasselhoff went on kickass adventures and hooked up with hot women and fought robots i guess david hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all only it was you yondu i had a pretty cool dad what im trying to say here is sometimes that thing youre searching for your whole life its right there by your side all along you dont even know it i am groot he did call you twig nebula i was a child like you i was concerned with staying alive until the next day every day and i never considered what thanos was doing to you im trying to make it right there are

a long way uptown i think the subways probably quickest me in a metal tube deep underground with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world right lets get a cab cab driver come on now

okay excuse me dr sterns  yes  im sorry to bother you im elizabeth ross oh dr ross  i have someone whod like to meet you  okay its mr blue isnt it mr green i got to tell you ive been wondering if you were even real and if you were what would it look like a person with that much power lurking in him nothing could have surprised me more than this unassuming man shaking my hand but look were not strolling into the park for a picnic here even if everything goes perfectly if we induce an episode if we get the dosage exactly right is that going to be a lasting cure or just some antidote to suppress that specific flareup i dont know what im saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer were dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity  you mean it could kill him  kill him yeah i should say so you should know that theres a flip side to this too if we miss on the low side if we induce me and it fails this will be very dangerous for you look ive always been more curious than cautious and thats served me pretty well so are we going to do this how you feeling man like a monster okay on the table these will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction you can tell me later if you thought it was strong oh come on stupid graduate students okay you you you this will be a somewhat novel sensation machine starting up we have begun the dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood except the antidote will only take hold once weve achieved a full reaction just relax okay we are comprehensive here you go all right we set to pop id take your hands off him grunting oh my god grunting screaming wait wait theres more wait  now okay now  sterns wait now do it do it bruce bruce look at me stay with me the antidote now sterns

okay youre okay you did it hes fine this is fantastic betty its over hi hi that was the most extraordinary thing i have seen in my entire life okay you know what stop please we need to go back and talk about what just happened in there absolutely okay the gamma pulse came from the amygdala  i think dr rosss primer  are you okay lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily and then it abates thats why you didnt die of radiation sickness years ago now maybe weve neutralised those cells permanently or maybe we just suppressed that event im inclined to think the latter but its hard to know because none of our test subjects ever survived  of course they werent getting the primer  wait wait  wait what did you just say  they werent getting  the myostatin primer  no no no test subjects what test subjects come with me  sparr whats the activity level  snipers are covering alpha sector sterns on radio we started on rats and mice but it just completely fried them so we had to go bigger and we still dont know which is more toxic the gamma or your blood  what do you mean my blood  bruce this is all you you didnt send me much to work with so i had to concentrate it and make more with a little more trial and error theres no end to what we can do this is potentially olympian this gamma technology has limitless applications well unlock hundreds of cures we will make humans impervious to disease no no weve got to destroy it  wait what  all of it tonight were gonna incinerate it  is this the whole supply  what we could get the nobel for this you dont understand the power of this

about is who else out there wants that orb they call me terrorist radical zealot because i obey the ancient laws of my people the kree and punish those who do not because i do not forgive your people for taking the life of my father and his father and his father before him a thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten you cant do this our government signed a peace treaty my government knows no shame you xandarians and your culture are a disease you will never rule xandar no i will cure it ronan korath has returned master he is a thief an outlaw who calls himself starlord but we have discovered he has an agreement to retrieve the orb for an intermediary known as the broker i promised thanos i would retrieve the orb for him only then will he destroy xandar for me nebula go to xandar and get me the orb it will be my honor it will be your doom if this happens again youll be facing our father without his prize im a daughter of thanos just like you but i know xandar ronan has already decreed that i do not speak for me you will not fail have i ever xandarians what a bunch of losers all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid to nothing at all pathetic look at this guy can you believe they call us criminals when hes assaulting us with that haircut what is this thing look how it thinks its so cool its not cool to get help walk by yourself you little gargoyle

authority of the nova corps  you are under arrest  all right come on up for endangerment to life and the destruction of property hey if it isnt starprince  starlord  sorry lord i picked this guy up a while back for petty theft hes got a code name yeah stay out of the way come on man its a its an outlaw name just relax pal its cool to have a code name its not that weird fascists ronan is destroying xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy i should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the kree we signed your peace treaty nova prime what more do you want at least a statement from the kree empire saying that they condemn his actions he is slaughtering children families that is your business now i have other matters to attend to prick well some good news it looks like weve apprehended one of ronans compatriots gamora surgically modified and trained as a living weapon the adopted daughter of the mad titan thanos recently thanos lent her and her sister nebula out to ronan which leads us to believe that thanos and ronan are working together subject p calls itself rocket the result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form what the hell they call it groot a humanoid plant thats been travelling recently as ps personal houseplantlmuscle peter jason quill from terra raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the ravagers led by yondu udonta im sorry i didnt know how this machine worked what a bunch of aholes transport all four to the kyln i guess most of nova corps wanna uphold the laws but these ones here theyre corrupt and cruel but hey thats not my problem i aint gonna be here long ive escaped  prisons this ones no different youre lucky the broad showed up because otherwise me and groot would be collecting that bounty right now and youd be getting drawn and quartered by yondu and those ravagers ive had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years i aint about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon hold  whats a raccoon  whats a raccoon its what you are stupid aint no thing like me except me so this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase ark of the covenant maltese falcon sort of vibe  what is it  i am groot so what whats the orb i have no words for an honorless thief pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac yeah i know who you are  anyone whos anyone knows who you are  yeah we know who you are  who is she  i am groot yeah you said that i wasnt retrieving the orb for ronan i was betraying him i had an agreement to sell it to a third party i am groot well thats just as fascinating as the first  times you told me that what is wrong with giving tree here well he dont know talking good like me and you so his vocabulistics is limited to i and am and groot exclusively in that order i tell you what thats gonna wear real thin real fast hey put that away hey listen to me you big blue bastard take those headphones off thats mine those belong to impound that tape and that player is mine hooked on a feeling blue swede  that song belongs to me  you first you first  murderer coming for you first gamora youre dead youre scum youre scum its like i said shes got a rep a lot of prisoners here have lost their families to ronan and his goons shell last a day tops murderer the guards will protect her right theyre here to stop us from getting out they dont care what we do to each other inside whatever nightmares the future holds are dreams compared to whats behind me check out the new meat im gonna slather you up in gunavian jelly and go to town lets make something clear this one here is our booty you wanna get to him you go through us or more accurately we go through you im with them i hate you no cells gonna protect you for long youre dead dead take her down to the showers itll be easier to clean up the blood down there quill where you going quill quill gamora consider this a death sentence for your crimes against the galaxy you dare you know who i am yes youre drax the destroyer quill and you know why they call me this you slayed dozens of ronans minions ronan murdered my wife ovette and my daughter camaria he slaughtered them where they stood and he laughed quill her life is not yours to take he killed my family i shall kill one of his in return of course drax here i quill what are you doing im no family to ronan or thanos im your only hope at stopping him woman your words mean nothing to me  hey hey hey hey hey  crap you know if killing ronan is truly your sole purpose i dont think this is the best way to go about it are you not the man this wench attempted to kill well i mean shes hardly the first woman to try and do that to me look this is from a smokinghot rajak girl stabbed me with a fork didnt like me skipping out on her at sunrise i got right here a kree girl tried to rip out my thorax she caught me with this skinny little aaskavariian who worked in nova records i was trying to get information you ever see an aaskavariian they have tentacles and needles for teeth if you think im seriously interested in that then you dont care but heres the point she betrayed ronan hes coming back for her and when he does thats when you why would i put my finger on his throat what no its a symbol this is a symbol for you slicing his throat i would not slice his throat i would cut his head clean off its a general expression for you killing somebody youve heard of this youve seen this right  you know what that is  yeah yeah  everyone knows  no no what im saying is you want to keep her alive dont do his work for him i like your knife im keeping it  that was my favorite knife  listen i could care less whether you live or whether you die  then why stop the big guy  simple you know where to sell my orb how are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here my friend rocket here has escaped  prisons were getting out and then were headed straight to yondu to retrieve your bounty how much was your buyer willing to pay you for my orb four billion units  what  holy shit that orb is my opportunity to get away from thanos and ronan if you free us ill lead you to the buyer directly and ill split the profit between the three of us i am groot four of us asleep for the danger awake for the money as per frickin usual you have been betrayed ronan we know only that she has been captured gamora may yet recover the orb no our sources within the kyln say gamora has her own plans for the orb look your partnership with thanos is at risk thanos requires your presence now with all due respect thanos your daughter made this mess and yet you summon me i would lower my voice accuser first she lost a battle with some primitive thanos put gamora under your charge then she was apprehended by the nova corps you are the one here with nothing to show for it your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time lower your tone i may be your i only ask that you take this matter seriously the only matter i do not take seriously boy is you your politics bore me your demeanor is that of a pouty child and apparently you alienated my favorite daughter gamora i shall honor our agreement kree if you bring me the orb but return to me again emptyhanded and i will bathe the starways in your blood thanks dad sounds fair this is one fight you wont win lets head to the kyln if were gonna get out of here were gonna need to get into that watchtower and to do that im gonna need a few things the guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs i need one leave it to me that dude there i need his prosthetic leg  his leg  yeah god knows i dont need the rest of him look at him hes useless all right and finally on the wall back there is a black panel blinky yellow light  do you see it  yeah theres a quarnyx battery behind it purplish box green wires to get into that watchtower i definitely need it how are we supposed to do that well supposably these baldbodies find you attractive so maybe you can work out some sort of trade you must be joking no i really heard they find you attractive look its  feet up in the air and its in the middle of the most heavilyguarded part of the prison its impossible to get up there without being seen i got one plan and that plan requires a frickin quarnyx battery so figure it out can i get back to it thanks now this is important once the battery is removed everything is gonna slam into emergency mode once we have it we gotta move quickly so you definitely need to get that last or we could just get it first and improvise  ill get the armband  leg prisoner drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell or we will open fire i am groot fire all prisoners return to your sleeping areas you idiot how am i supposed to fight these things without my stuff the animal is in control fire on my command creepy little beast oh yeah you need my what  ill need this  good luck its internally wired ill figure something out drop the leg drop the leg and move back to your cell rocket move to the watchtower you man who has lain with an aaskavariian it was one time man we need all available guards in full combat gear spare me your foul gaze woman why is this one here we promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss i always keep my promises when theyre to musclebound whackjobs who will kill me if i dont here you go i was just kidding about the leg i just need these two things  what  no i thought itd be funny was it funny wait what did he look like hopping around i had to transfer him  units how are we going to leave well hes got a plan right or is that another thing you made up i have a plan i have a plan cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement yeah ill have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one do not ever call me a thesaurus its just a metaphor dude his people are completely literal metaphors are gonna go over his head nothing goes over my head my reflexes are too fast i would catch it im gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy those are some big guns on my command number one  rodent we are ready for your plan  hold on number two i recognize this animal wed roast them over a flame pit as children  their flesh was quite delicious  not helping number three all fire on my command three two one he turned off the artificial gravity everywhere but

might try trusting me a little bit and how much do you trust me id trust you a lot more if you told me what this was because im guessing its some kind of weapon i dont know what it is if its a weapon we should use it against ronan put it down you fool youll destroy us all or just you murderess i let you live once princess  i am not a princess  hey nobody is killing anybody on my ship were stuck together until we get the money i have no interest in money great that means more money for the three of us for the four of us partners we have an agreement but i would never be partners with the likes of you ill tell the buyer were on our way and quill your ship is filthy she has no idea if i had a black light the place would look like a jackson pollock painting you got issues quill i swear i

your frickin face no no no no four billion units rocket come on man hey suck it up for one more lousy night and youre rich fine but i cant promise when all this is over im not gonna kill every last one of you jerks see thats exactly why none of you have any friends five seconds after you meet somebody youre already trying to kill them we have travelled halfway across the quadrant and ronan is no closer to being dead  drax  let him go we dont need him milady gamora im here to fetch you for my master okay this isnt creepy at all we house the galaxys largest collection of fauna relics and species of all manner i present to you taneleer tivan the collector oh my dear gamora how wonderful to meet in the flesh lets bypass the formalities tivan we have what we discussed what is that thing there i am groot i never thought id meet a groot sir you must allow me to pay you now so that i may own your carcass at the moment of your death of course i am groot why so he could turn you into a frickin chair thats your pet  his what  tivan we have been halfway around the galaxy retrieving this orb very well then let us see what you brought three quarnyx batteries seven cases of cotati seeds no cases last time you sent me you shall send a message for me oh my new friends before creation itself there were six singularities then the universe exploded into existence and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots infinity stones these stones it seems can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength observe these carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field theres a little pee coming out of me right now once for a moment a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves but even they were quickly destroyed by it beautiful beyond compare were all very fascinated whitey but wed like to get paid how would you like to get paid what do you think fancy man units very well then carina stand back i will no longer be your slave no what the how could i think tivan could contain whatever was within the orb  what do you still have it for  what are we gonna do leave it in there  i cant believe you had that in your purse  its not a purse its a knapsack we have to bring this to the nova corps theres a chance they can contain it are you kidding me were wanted by the nova corps  just give it to ronan  so he can destroy the galaxy what are you some saint all of a sudden what has the galaxy ever done for you why would you wanna save it because im one of the idiots who lives in it peter listen to me we cannot allow the stone to fall into ronans hands we have to go back to your ship and deliver it to nova right right okay i think youre right or we could give it to somebody whos not going to arrest us whos really nice for a whole lot of money i think its a really good balance between both of your points of view youre despicable dishonorable faithless  no  at last i shall meet my foe and destroy him you called ronan quill dont you move boy dont you move get out of the way ronan the accuser you are the one who transmitted the message you killed my wife you killed my daughter i told you you cant fit now wait here ill be back it is gamora she is escaping with the orb no nebula retrieve the orb the stone is in the furthest pod bring it down rocket keep them off gamora until she gets to the milano how weve got no weaponry on these things these pods are industrial grade theyre nearly indestructible not against necroblasts theyre not thats not what im saying let me borrow your ride i dont recall killing your family i doubt ill remember killing you either quill im trapped i cant make it to the milano i have to head out wait these things arent meant to go out there you are a disappointment sister of all our siblings i hated you least nebula please if ronan gets this stone  hell kill us all  not all you will already be dead ronan it is done quill come on her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes but theres nothing we can do for her these pods arent meant to be out here in a second were gonna be in the same boat damn it quill yondu yondu this is quill  my coordinates are  k  quill quill what are you doing just outside knowhere if youre there come get me im all yours quill dont be ridiculous get back into your pod you cant fit two people in there youre gonna die youll die in seconds quill quill what happened i saw you out there i dont know what came over me but i couldnt let you die i found something inside of myself something incredibly heroic i mean not to brag but objectively wheres the orb its well they got the orb what welcome home peter blasted idiot theyre all idiots quill just got himself captured none of this ever would have happened if you didnt try to singlehandedly take on a frickin army youre right i was a fool all the anger all the rage was just to cover my loss my wife and child are dead i dont care if its mean everybodys got dead people its no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way come on groot ronan has the stone the only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe as fast as we can and maybe just maybe well be able to live full lives before that whackjob ever gets there i am groot save them how i am groot i know theyre the only friends that we ever had but theres an army of ravagers around them and theres only two of us three youre making me beat up grass the orb is in my possession as i promised bring it to me yes that was our agreement bring you the orb and you will destroy xandar for me however now that i know it contains an infinity stone i wonder what use i have for you boy i would reconsider your current course master you cannot thanos is the most powerful being in the universe not anymore you call me boy i will unfurl  years of kree justice on xandar and burn it to its core then thanos i am coming for you after xandar you are going to kill my father you dare to oppose me you see what he has turned me into if you kill him i will help you destroy a thousand planets you betray me steal my money stop it leave him alone when i picked you up as a kid these boys wanted to eat you they aint never tasted terran before i saved your life will you shut up about that god twenty years you been throwing that in my face like its some great thing not eating me normal people dont even think about eating someone else much less that person having to be grateful for it you abducted me man you stole me from my home and from my family you dont give a damn about your terra youre scared because youre soft in here here right here yondu listen to me ronan has something called an infinity stone i know what hes got girl then you know we must get it back hes gonna use it to wipe out xandar we have to warn them billions of people will perish is that what shes been filling your head with boy sentiment eating away your brain like maggots thats it no sorry boy but a captains gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him captains gotta teach stuff if you kill me now you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen the stone i hope you got something better than that because aint nobody stealing from ronan we got a ringer is that right she knows everything there is to know about ronan his ships his army hes vulnerable hey what do you say yondu me and you taking down a mark sidebyside like the old days let him go you always did have a scrote boy thats why i kept you on as a youngun captain the shot was nondamaging attention idiots the lunatic on top of this craft is holding a hadron enforcer its a weapon of my own design what the hell if you dont hand over our companions now hes gonna tear your ship a new one a very big new one  i aint buyin it  im giving you to the count of five      no wait hold on rocket its me for god sakes we figured it out were fine hey quill whats going on you call that figured it out were gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless you want to talk about senseless how about trying to save us by blowing us up we were only gonna blow you up if they didnt turn you over and how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five we didnt have time to work out the minutiae of the plan this is what we get for acting altruistically  i am groot  they are ungrateful whats important now is we get the ravagers army to help us save xandar so we can give the stone to yondu whos just gonna sell to somebody even worse  well figure that part out later  we have to stop ronan how  i have a plan  youve got a plan yes first of all youre copying me from when i said i had a plan no im not people say that all the time its not that unique of a thing to say secondly i dont even believe you have a plan i have part of a plan what percentage of a plan do you have you dont get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on knowhere i just saved quill weve already established that you destroying the ship that im on is not saving me  when did we establish it  like three seconds ago i wasnt listening i was thinking of something else shes right you dont get an opinion what percentage  i dont know twelve percent  twelve percent thats a fake laugh  its real  totally fake that is the most real authentic hysterical laugh of my entire life  because that is not a plan  its barely a concept  youre taking their side  i am groot so what its better than  what the hell does that have to do with anything thank you groot thank you see groots the only one of you who has a clue guys come on yondu is gonna be here in two seconds he expects to hear this big plan of ours i need your help i look around at us you know what i see losers i mean like folks who have lost stuff and we have man we have all of us our homes our families normal lives and usually life takes more than it gives but not today today its given us something it has given us a chance to do what to give a shit for once not run away i for one am not gonna stand by and watch as ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives but quill stopping ronan its impossible youre asking us to die yeah i guess i am quill i have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies i will be grateful to die among my friends you are an honorable man quill i will fight beside you and in the end i will see my wife and daughter again i am groot what the hell i dont got that long a lifespan anyway now im standing yall happy were all standing up now bunch of jackasses standing in a circle the stone reacts to anything organic the bigger the target the bigger the power surge all ronans got to do is touch the stone to the planets surface and zap all plants animals  nova corps  everything will die so ronan does not make the surface rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the dark asters starboard hull then our craft and yondus will enter wont there be hundreds of sakaaran soldiers inside i think of sakaaran as paper people once they know were on board ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck which i can disable by dismantling the power source well make it to the flight deck and ill use the hadron enforcer to kill ronan once ronan is dead we will retrieve the stone use these devices to contain it if you touch it it will kill you ill contact one of the nova officers who arrested us hopefully theyll believe were there to help theres one more thing we need to complete the plan that guys eye no no we dont no we dont need that guys eye no seriously i need it its important to me ronans fleet has been spotted and will arrive in tminus fifteen minutes remember boy at the end of all this i get the stone you cross me we kill you all lets go get em boys this is a terrible plan hey youre the one who said you wanted to die among friends nova prime i received a transmission from one of the ravagers he says ronans in possession of something called an infinity stone and hes headed toward xandar good god its a trick hes a criminal did he say why we should believe him he said his crew just escaped from prison so hed have no other reason to risk coming to xandar to help he says that hes an ahole but hes not and im quoting him here  a dick do you believe him i dont know that i believe anyone is  a dick maam i mean do you believe that he is here to help yeah a fleet approaches they appear to be ravagers fire cover it down submerge rocket hurry all pilots dive theyre beneath us evacuate the city our priority is to get our people away from the battle forward thrust now come on quill yondu now hell im going down quill no more games with me boy ill see you at the end of this there are too many of them rocket well never make it up there peter quill this is denarian saal of the nova corps for the record i advised against trusting you here they got my dick message prove me wrong yes yes were just like kevin bacon the starboard kern has been breached we have been boarded continue our approach but the nova corps have engaged none of that will matter once we reach the surface seal security doors now get out of my way oh man all nova pilots interlock and form a blockade the dark aster must not reach the ground locked in locked in were locked in i can barely see when did you learn to do that pretty sure the answer is i am groot the flight deck is  meters this way i want you all to know that i am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders it is pleasing to once again have friends you quill are my friend thanks this dumb tree he is my friend  and this green whore she too  you must stop gamora look at what you have done you have always been weak you stupid traitorous nobody talks to my friends like that head to the flight deck ill shut down the power to the security doors yondu udonta order your men to turn on the nova corps enough nonsense ravager time to die nebula please enough of this necrocraft pilots enact immolation initiative theyre divebombing the city denarian saal should we break formation no hold your positions keep ronan up there saal well take care of the people down here i cant believe im taking orders from a hamster starlord finally you thief you will never make it to ronan everybody shoot them before they hit the ground come on finger to the throat means death metaphor yeah sorta no xandar you stand accused your wretched peace treaty will not save you now it is the tinder on which you burn rocket hold on saal just quill you gotta hurry the citys been evacuated but were getting our asses kicked down here gamora hasnt opened the door nebula sister help us fight ronan you know hes crazy i know youre both crazy no what the get out you did it i was mistaken i do remember your family their screams were pitiful i no groot you cant youll die why are you doing this why we are groot i called him an idiot you killed groot behold your guardians of the galaxy what fruit have they wrought only that my father and his father shall finally know vengeance people of xandar the time has come to rejoice and renounce your paltry gods your salvation is at hand listen to these words now bring it down hard what are you doing danceoff bro me and you gamora subtle take it back what are you doing im distracting you you big turd blossom no peter take my hand take my hand peter mom take my hand youre mortal how you said it yourself bitch were the guardians of the galaxy well well well quite the light show aint this sweet but you got some business to attend to before all the nookienookie starts peter you cant peter you gotta reconsider this yondu i dont know who youre selling this to but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the nova corps i may be as pretty as an angel but i sure as hell aint one hand it over son yondu do not open that orb you know that right youve seen what it does to people yeah quill turned out okay its probably good we didnt deliver him to his dad like we was hired to do yeah that guy was a jackass he is gonna be so pissed when he realizes i switched out the orb on him he was gonna kill you peter i know but he was about the only family i had no he wasnt why would you even know this when we arrested you we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system so we had it checked out im not terran you are half terran your mother was of earth your father well hes something very ancient weve never seen here before that could be why you were able to hold the stone for as long as you did your friends have arrived on behalf of the nova corps wed like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving xandar if you will follow denarian dey  he has something to show you  thank you nova prime your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them yes of course ronan was only a puppet its really thanos i need to kill we tried to keep it as close to the original as possible we salvaged as much as we could i thank you i have a family theyre alive because of you your criminal records have also been expunged however i have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future question what if i see something that i want to take  and it belongs to someone else  you will be arrested but what if i want it more than the person who has it  its still illegal  that doesnt follow no i want it more sir do you understand what are you laughing at why i cant have a discussion with this gentleman what if someone does something irksome and i decide to remove his spine thats thats actually murder its one of the worst crimes of all so also illegal theyll be fine dey im gonna keep an eye on em you yeah me peter i know these last few months have been hard for you but im going to a better place and i will be okay and i will

tearjerker i dont know if youre ever gonna see these i dont even know if youre still oh god i hope so todays day  no  you know if it wasnt for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space id say im feeling a little better today infections run its course thanks to the blue meanie back there youd love her very practical only a tiny bit sadistic so the fuel cells were cracked during battle and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge and bought ourselves about  hours of flight time but its now dead in the water thousand light years from the nearest eleven oxygen will run out tomorrow morning and thatll be it pep i know i said no more surprises but i got to say i was really hoping to pull off one last one but it looks like well you know what it looks like dont feel bad about this i mean actually if you grovel for a couple weeks and then move on with enormous guilt i should probably lie down for a minute go rest my eyes please know when i drift off itll be like every night lately im fine totally fine i dream about you because its always you couldnt stop him neither could i hang on i lost the kid tony we lost is  oh good  oh my god oh my god its okay its been  days since thanos came to earth world governments are in pieces the parts that are still working are trying to take a census and it looks like he did he did exactly what he said he was gonna do thanos wiped out  of all living creatures where is he now where we dont know he just opened a portal and walked through whats wrong with him hes pissed he thinks he failed which of course he did but theres a lot of that going around aint there honestly until this exact second i thought you were a buildabear maybe i am weve been hunting thanos for three weeks now deep space scans and satellites and we got nothing tony you fought him who told you that i didnt fight him no he wiped my face with a planet while the bleecker street magician gave away the store thats what happened there was no fight cause hes not beatable did he give you any clues any coordinates anything i saw this coming a few years back i had a vision i didnt wanna believe it thought i was dreaming tony im gonna need you to focus and i needed you as in past tense that trumps what you need its too late buddy sorry you know what i need i need a shave and i believe i remember telling all youse tony tony alive and otherwise that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world remember that whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not thats what we needed well that didnt work out did it i said wed lose you said well do that together too and guess what cap we lost and you werent there but thats what we do right our best work after the fact were the avengers were the avengers not the prevengers  okay  right you made your point just sit down okay okay no no heres my point you know what  shes great by the way  tony youre sick sit down we need you youre new blood bunch of tired old mules i got nothing for you cap i got no coordinates no clues no strategies no options zero zip nada no trust liar here take this you find him you put that on you hide  tony  im fine let me bruce gave him a sedative hes gonna probably be out for the rest of the day you guys take care of him and ill bring him a xorrian elixir when i come back where are you going to kill thanos hey you know we usually work as a team here and between you and i morales a little fragile we realize up there is more your territory but this is our fight too you even know where he is i know people who might dont bother i can tell you where thanos is thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me and when he worked he talked about his great plan even disassembled i wanted to please him id ask where would we go once his plan was complete and his answer was always the same to the garden thats cute thanos has a retirement plan so where is he when thanos snapped his fingers earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions no ones ever seen anything like it until two days ago on this planet thanos is there he used the stones again hey hey hey wed be going in shorthanded you know look hes still got the stones so so lets get em use them to bring everyone back just like that yeah just like that even if theres a small chance that we can undo this i mean we owe it to everyone whos not in this room to try if we do this how do we know its gonna end any differently than it did before because before you didnt have me hey new girl everybody in this room is about that superhero life and if you dont mind my asking where the hell have you been all this time there are a lot of other planets in the universe and unfortunately they didnt have you guys i like this one lets go get this son of a bitch okay who here hasnt been to space why you better not throw up on my ship approaching jump in three two one ill head down for recon this is gonna work steve i know it will cause i dont know what im gonna do if it doesnt no satellites no ships no armies no ground defenses of any kind its just him and thats enough oh no where are they answer the question the universe required correction after that the stones served no purpose beyond temptation you murdered trillions you should be grateful where are the stones gone reduced to atoms you used them two days ago i used the stones to destroy the stones it nearly killed me but the work is done it always will be i am inevitable we have to tear this place apart he has to be lying my father is many things a liar is not one of them thank you daughter perhaps i treated you too harshly what what did you do i went for the head so i went on a date the other day its the first time in five years you know im sitting there at dinner i didnt even know what to talk about what did you talk about same old crap you know how things have changed my job his job how much we miss the mets and then things got quiet then he cried as they were serving the salads what about you i cried just before dessert but im seeing him again tomorrow so thats great you did the hardest part you took the jump you didnt know where you were gonna come down and thats it thats those little brave baby steps we got to take to try and become whole again try and find purpose i went in the ice in  right after i met the love of my life woke up  years later you got to move on gotta move on the world is in our hands its left to us guys and we got to do something with it otherwise thanos shouldve killed all of us what the hell hope kid hey kid what the hell happened here oh my god oh please please please no no no no no excuse me sorry cassie no no no no no no please please please no cassie what cassie dad youre so big yeah we boarded that highlysuspect warship danvers pinged it was an infectious garbage scow so thanks for the hot tip well you were closer yeah and now we smell like garbage you get a reading on those tremors twas a mild subduction under the african plate do we have a visual how are we handling it nat its an earthquake under the ocean we handle it by not handling it carol are we seeing you here next month  not likely  what you gonna get another haircut listen fur face im covering a lot of territory the things that are happening on earth are happening everywhere on thousands of planets all right all right thats a good point thats a good point so you might not see me for a long time all right well this channels always active so if anything goes sideways anyones making trouble where they shouldnt comes through me okay all right good luck where are you mexico the federales found a room full of bodies looks like a bunch of cartel guys never even had a chance to get their guns off its probably a rival gang except it isnt its definitely barton what hes done here what hes been doing for the last few years i mean the scene that he left i got to tell you theres a part of me that doesnt even wanna find him will you find out where hes going next nat please okay you know id offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already you here to do your laundry and to see a friend clearly your friend is fine you know i saw a pod of whales when i was coming over the bridge  in the hudson  theres fewer ships cleaner water you know if youre about to tell me to look on the bright side im about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich sorry force of habit you know i keep telling everybody they should move on and grow some do but not us if i move on who does this maybe it doesnt need to be done i used to have nothing and then i got this this job this family and i was better because of it and even though theyre gone im still trying to be better i think we both need to get a life you first hi hi is anyone home this is scott lang we met a few years ago at the airport in germany i was the guy that got really big i had a mask on  you wouldnt recognize me  is this an old message antman i know you know that  its the front gate  i really need to talk to you guys scott are you okay yeah have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics only to make conversation all right so five years ago right before thanos i was in a place called the quantum realm the quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe to get in there you have to be incredibly small hope shes my she was my she was supposed to pull me out and then thanos happened and i got stuck in there im sorry that must have been a very long five years yeah but thats just it it wasnt for me it was five hours see the rules of the quantum realm arent like they are up here everything is unpredictable is that anybodys sandwich im starving scott what are you talking about so what im saying is time works differently in the quantum realm the only problem is right now we dont have a way to navigate it but what if we did i cant stop thinking about it what if we could somehow control the chaos and we could navigate it what if there was a way that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time like  like before thanos  wait are you talking about a time machine no no of course not no not a time machine this is more like a yeah like a time machine i know its crazy its crazy but i cant stop thinking about it theres got to be some way  its crazy  scott i get emails from a raccoon so nothing sounds crazy anymore so who do we talk to about this chow time maguna morgan h stark you want some lunch  define lunch or be disintegrated  okay you should not be wearing that okay that is part of a special anniversary gift im making for mom there you go you thinking about lunch i can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce  no  thats what you want how did you find this  garage  really  were you looking for it  no i found it though you like going in the garage huh so does daddy its fine actually mom never wears anything i buy her so im gonna no we know what it sounds like tony after everything youve seen is anything really impossible quantum fluctuation messes with the planck scale which then triggers the deutsch proposition can we agree on that thank you in laymans terms it means youre not coming home  i did  no you accidentally survived its a billiontoone cosmic fluke and now you wanna pull a what do you call it a time heist yeah a time heist of course why didnt we think of this before oh because its laughable because its a pipe dream the stones are in the past we could go back we could get them we can snap our own fingers we can bring everybody back or screw it up worse than he already has right i dont believe we would gotta say it i sometimes miss that giddy optimism however high hopes wont help if theres no logical tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist i believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel all right it means no talking to our past selves no betting on sporting events im gonna stop you right there scott are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on back to the future  is it  no good you had me worried there cause that would be horseshit thats not how quantum physics works tony we have to take a stand we did stand and yet here we are i know you got a lot on the line you got a wife a daughter but i lost someone very important to me a lotta people did and now now we have a chance to bring her back to bring everyone back and youre telling me that you wont even thats right scott i wont even i

else here kill that guy nope didnt think so korg why dont you tell everybody who chopped thanos big head off stormbreaker who was swinging stormbreaker i get it youre in a rough spot okay ive been there myself and you want to know who helped me out of it was it natasha it was you you helped me so why dont you ask the asgardians down there how much my help is worth the ones that are left anyway i think we could bring them back stop stop okay i know you think im down here wallowing in my own selfpity waiting to be rescued and saved but im fine okay were fine arent we were good here mate so whatever it is that youre offering were not into it dont care couldnt care less goodbye we need you pal theres beer on the ship what kind its him hes after akihiko why are you doing this we never did anything to you you survived half the planet didnt they got thanos you get me youre done hurting people we hurt people youre crazy wait help me ill give you anything what do you want what i want you cant give me you shouldnt be here neither should you ive got a job to do is that what youre calling this killing all these people isnt gonna bring your family back we found something a chance maybe dont dont what dont give me hope im sorry i couldnt give it to you sooner youre drifting left one side there lebowski ratchet hows it going its rocket take it easy youre only a genius on earth pal time travel suit not bad hey hey hey easy easy im being very careful no youre being very hulky im being careful these are pym particles all right and ever since hank pym got snapped out of existence this is it this is what we have were not making any more  scott calm down  sorry weve got enough for one roundtrip each thats it no doovers plus two test runs one test run all right im not ready for this im game ill do it clint now youre gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift  dont worry about that  wait a second let me ask you something if we can do this you know go back in time why dont we just find baby thanos you know and  first of all thats horrible  its thanos and secondly time doesnt work that way changing the past doesnt change the future look we go back we get the stones before thanos gets them thanos doesnt have the stones problem solved  bingo  thats not how it works  well thats what i heard  wait but who who told you that star trek terminator timecop  time after time  quantum leap  wrinkle in time somewhere in time  hot tub time machine hot tub time machine bill and teds excellent adventure basically any movie that deals with time travel die hard no thats not one this is known i dont know why everyone believes that but that isnt true think about it if you travel to the past that past becomes your future and your former present becomes the past which cant now be changed by your new future exactly so back to the future is a bunch of bullshit all right clint were going in three two one cooper where are my headphones lila  i never had them  lila yeah you had them yesterday lila lila yeah dad dad lila hey hey look at me you okay yeah yeah it worked it worked okay so the how works now we got to figure out the when and the where almost everyone in this room has had an encounter with at least one of the six infinity stones or substitute the word encounter for damn near been killed by one of the six infinity stones well i havent but i dont even know what the hell youre all talking about regardless we only have enough pym particles for one roundtrip each and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history our history so not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in yeah which means we have to pick our targets correct so lets start with the aether thor what do you know is he asleep no no im pretty sure hes dead where to start the aether firstly is not a stone someone called it a stone before its more of an angry sludge sort of a thing so someones gonna need to amend that and stop saying that heres an interesting story though about the aether my grandfather many years ago had to hide the stone from the dark elves scary beings so jane actually oh there she is yeah so jane was an old flame of mine you know she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time and then the aether stuck itself inside her and she became very very sick and so i had to take her to asgard which is where im from and we had to try and fix her we were dating at the time you see and i got to introduce her to my mother whos dead and oh you know jane and i arent even dating anymore so yes these things happen though you know nothing lasts forever the only thing that  why dont you come sit down  im not done yet the only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence awesome eggs breakfast no id like a bloody mary quill said he stole the power stone from morag  is that a person  no morags a planet quill was a person like a planet like in outer space oh look its like a little puppy all happy and everything do you wanna go to space you wanna go to space puppy ill take you to space thanos found the soul stone on vormir what is vormir a dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence its where thanos murdered my sister not it  that time stone guy  doctor strange yeah what kind of doctor was he earnosethroat meets rabbitfromhat nice place in the village though yeah on sullivan street bleecker

to expect be careful look out for each other this is the fight of our lives and were gonna win whatever it takes good luck hes pretty good at that  right  all right you heard the man stroke those keys jolly green trackers engaged you promise to bring that back in one piece right yeah yeah yeah okay ill do my best as promises go that was pretty lame see ya in a minute all right we all have our assignments two stones uptown one stone down stay low keep an eye on the clock maybe smash a few things along the way i think its gratuitous but whatever id be careful going that way we just had the

is alive what that is americas ass please please im sorry i cant help you bruce if i give up the time stone to help your reality im dooming my own with all due respect all right im not sure the science really supports that the infinity stones create what you experience as the flow of time remove one of the stones and that flow splits now this may benefit your reality but my new one not so much in this new branch reality without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness our world would be overrun millions will suffer so tell me doctor can your science prevent all that no but we can erase it because once were done with the stones we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken so chronologically in that reality it never left yes but youre leaving out the most important part in order to return the stones you have to survive we will i will i promise i cant risk this reality on a promise its the duty of the sorcerer supreme to protect the time stone then why the hell did strange give it away what did you say strange he gave it away he gave it to thanos  willingly  yes  why  i have no idea maybe he made a mistake or i did strange is meant to be the best of us so he mustve done it for a reason i fear you might be right thank you im counting on you bruce we all are run diagnostics show me her memory file sire the file appears entangled it was a memory but not hers theres another consciousness sharing her network another nebula impossible this duplicate carries a time stamp from nine years in the future where is this other nebula in our solar system on morag can you access her yes the two are linked search the duplicates memories for infinity stones and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history our history so

meet you oh my god what the hell is this friday what are they firing at something just entered the upper atmosphere oh yeah danvers we need an assist here hi im peter parker hey peter parker you got something for me i dont know how youre gonna get it through all of that dont worry shes got help i am inevitable and i am iron man mr stark hey mr stark can you hear me its peter hey we won mr stark we won mr stark we won you did it sir you did it im sorry tony hey hey pep friday life functions critical tony look at me were gonna be okay you can rest now everybody wants a happy ending right but it doesnt always roll that way maybe this time im hoping if you play this back its in celebration i hope families are reunited i hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored if there ever was such a thing god what a world universe now if you told me  years ago that we werent alone let alone to this extent i mean i wouldnt have been surprised but come on who knew the epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play and for better or worse thats the reality morgans gonna have to find a way to grow up in so i thought id probably better record a little greeting in the case of an untimely death on my part not that death at any time isnt untimely this time travel thing that were gonna try and pull off tomorrow its got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all thats the thing then again thats the hero gig right part of the journey is the end what am i even tripping for everything is gonna work out exactly the way its supposed to i love you  you know i wish there was a way that i could let her know that we won we did it she knows they both do how you doing squirt good  you good  mmhmm  good you hungry  mmhmm what do you want cheeseburgers you know your dad liked cheeseburgers okay im gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want okay so when can we expect you back about that thor your people need a king no they already have one thats funny are you being serious its time for me to be who i am rather than who im supposed to be but you youre a leader thats who you are you know id make a lot of changes around here im counting on it your majesty what will you do im not sure for the first time in a thousand years i have no path i do have a ride though move it or lose it hairbag here we are tree good to see you the asgardians of the galaxy back together again where to first hey just so you know this is my ship still im in charge i know i know of course you are of course see you say of course but then you touch the map it makes you think that maybe you didnt realize i was in charge quail thats your own insecurities in there quail okay i am merely trying to be of service and assisting quill thats what i said you should fight one another for the honor of leadership sounds fair  its not necessary okay  its not i got some blasters unless you guys wanna use knives oh yes please use knives yeah knives i am groot not necessary there shall be no knifing one another everybody knows whos in charge me right yes you of course of course of course remember you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got em or youre gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities dont worry bruce clip all the branches you know i tried when i had the gauntlet the stones i really tried to bring her back i miss her man me too you know if you want i could come with you youre a good man sam this ones on me though dont do anything stupid till i get back how can i youre taking all the stupid with you gonna miss you buddy its gonna be okay buck how long is this gonna take for him as long as he needs for us five seconds you ready cap all right well meet you back here okay you bet going quantum three two one and returning in five four three two one where is he i dont know he blew right by his time stamp he should be here get him back  im trying  get him the hell back  hey i said im trying  sam go ahead cap hi sam so did something go wrong or did something go right well after i put the stones back i thought maybe ill try some of that life tony was telling me to get howd that work out for ya it was beautiful good im happy for you truly thank you only thing bumming me out is the fact i have to live in a world without captain america that reminds me try it on how does it feel like its someone elses it isnt thank you ill do my best thats why its yours you wanna tell me about her no no i dont think i willi still think about the night your mother and i had to leave you hopefully its not for long but ill call you when we get settled when i have a better indication of whats going on mommy jellybean daddy and i have a lastminute business trip so rose is gonna stay with you for a few days no i dont want you to go ugh its gonna be so boring i wont be able to keep my eyes goodbye sweetheart all right well see you soon okay janet we gotta go i wish we could have put down our bags tucked you back into your bed but too many lives were at stake oh my god theyve already launched we have to stop it come on to disarm the missile we had to get inside it but the plating was too thick the only way in was to shrink between the molecules i cant get through hank we both knew that if you go that small there is no coming back it should have been me but my regulator was damaged your mothers wasnt tell hope i love her she turned it off janet no she went subatomic to deactivate the bomb your mother saved thousands of lives that day knowing shed be lost in the quantum realm alone afraid gone forever telling you that she wasnt coming home was the hardest thing that i ever had to do but then scott showed up or should i say broke into our house and when he went to the quantum realm and came back everything changed i started to wonder could your mother still be alive so i dusted off some old plans dad what are you saying i think its possible to bring her back okay were in oh this place is a maze wheres that map were definitely close  you ready  im ready daddy are you sure cause once were inside you show any hesitation or fear were done i eat fear for breakfast wow that is super cool come on look its anton hell show us the way anton which way do we go anton which way do we go thanks anton look the ants have burrowed into the tech facility oh no lasers oh i think i got lased the secret vault tell me you brought the contact lens yup perfect right there there its the microtreasure my trophy it looks like treasure oh it is to me i want to take it to showandtell oh no you cant do that you cant it never leaves the house its too important this is the best birthday present you ever got me im so touched you think im the worlds greatest grandma it was the only one they had it makes me want to knit you a sweater oh no the fuzz hey scotty i was looking at the schematics for the karapetyan buildings and i think we have way too many security cameras dont we no no not at all i mean cause its a lot of security cameras i know what he needs whos the security expert in our business you are but im running the company right and if we overquote him hes gonna go somewhere else i mean we gotta land this bird he aint goin anywhere and the expression is land this fish no its land the bird just like you land the plane you gotta land the plane to be in business i know its silly to get hung up on these kinds of things but i do how am i gonna land a fish it cant walk and if it swam up on shore and it battled a hawk whos gonna win youve really turned me around on this thing its okay were gonna land karapetyan now if you just excuse me im in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter im gonna go recheck it to the escape ant lets bounce before the popo come back the popo how do you even know that lets fly antoinette lets fly crash landing whoo i wish we could shrink for real oh that is pretty cool hey im headed to the office scotty and sorry about freaking out earlier you know but i feel like im way better my heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff and my hands are shaking but i think its unrelated you know its gonna be great luis you got nothing to worry about yeah yeah im the boss im the boss im the boss yeah yeah yeah yeah daddy come on woo ive got three days left why would i try to escape sorry scott but rules are rules you trip the perimeter alarm we search the place keel to stern soup to nuts thank you it was an accident my foot went through the fence our flying ant crashed hey you try and entertain a yearold when you cant leave the house you know the lengths that ive gone to closeup magic i learned that why cant you just leave my daddy alone oh cassie this must all seem like a bunch of confusing grownup stuff to you huh well think of it this way your school has rules right like you cant draw on the walls well your daddy went to germany and drew on the walls with captain america and that was a violation of article  paragraph three of the sokovia accords now as a part of his joint plea deal with homeland security and the german government he was allowed to return to the us provided he serve two years under house arrest followed by three years of probation and avoid any unauthorized activities technology or contact with any former associates who were or currently are in violation of said accords or any related statutes okay sweetie wow youre really great with kids thanks im also a youth pastor anyway not to be a johnny askalot but you havent had any contact with hank pym or hope van dyne have you  no  you sure because its only a matter of time before we get em it was their tech so they violated the accords too and associating with them breaks your deal and uh i dont need to remind you that any violation of your agreement means  years in prison minimum i havent talked to hank or hope in forever they hate his guts thanks peanut howd you do it scott do what the card trick seriously oh my god you people cant just show up here whenever you want and search the place actually they can you need a warrant actually they dont really wow did you pack your soccer shoes  yeah  all right next time i see you will be on the outside all right oh get on the inside of this hey three days seriously  im proud of you bud  thank you you know what give me another one me too gosh freedom new business i am sensing greatness i had a fun weekend daddy me too peanut but just wait till next weekend once im outta here you and i are gonna go paint this town red well have so much ice cream well never stop puking youre gettin good at that howd you do that  bye daddy  bye  bye  bye three days easypeasy snap your fingers that gets them to look over there and that is misdirection âª we had a dream âª wed go travelin together âª wed spread a little lovin then wed keep movin on âª easypeasy where are you everything that you know lost in the quantum realm what im gonna find you jellybean i found you you always find me mommy what the hell hey hank its been a while um i dont even know if this is your number anymore and im probably the last person you wanna hear from but i just had a really weird dream and i know that doesnt sound like an emergency or anything but it just felt very real i was back in the quantum realm and i think i saw your wife and then i was your wife i mean not in a weird way or anything you know hearing this out loud im thinking uh its not an emergency im sorry to bother you im sorry for a lot of things that means one tiny atom in my fingernail could be could be one little tiny universe hope is this another dream do you think it was a dream or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there im not sure i cant be here i cant be here im under house arrest they wont open while the systems engaged scott you have to take me home they could show up any second relax as far as your nanny cops know youre still at home whoa scotty hes programmed to replicate your daily routine nine hours in bed five hours in front of the tv two hours in the bathroom whatever thats about thats totally inaccurate and how do you know about my daily routine are you spying on me we keep tabs on all security threats all right and so far the biggest one weve had is you im sorry about germany they just showed up they said it was a matter of national security that cap needed help so cap tain america captain cap its what we call him if youre a friend im not saying im a friend of a little i know him hes nice whatever im sorry all right i didnt think id get caught you didnt think about a lot of things hows hank were still running the house is gone so is our freedom how do you think he is im sorry i know youre mad im not looking for an apology scott the only reason why were even talking is because we need whats in your head is this where youre living if you need help or money or something maybe i can were fine hey hank look i just wanna save it  can we start  yeah so while you were relaxing at home we were building this its a tunnel to the quantum realm to my mom we think she might still be down there we just dont know where what if we can pinpoint my moms location then the pod can take me down to get her you built all this and you dont even know if shes alive its called a hypothesis last night we powered up the tunnel for the first time it was overloaded and it shut down but for a split second the doorway to the quantum realm was opened and and five minutes later you called talking about mom we think when you were down there you may have entangled with her hank i would never do that i respect you too much quantum entanglement scott we think she might have put some kind of a message in your head hopefully a location and opening the tunnel triggered it your mom put a message in my head come on thats insane no scott insane is going to germany without telling us and fighting the avengers just tell me you werent lying about the suit you took tell me you really destroyed it i did i destroyed it i swear i cant believe you destroyed my suit that was my lifes work what was i supposed to do you were supposed to not take my suit im sorry hank im sorry i took the suit im sorry that i called last night i dont remember seeing janet down there i wish that i did i just had a dream about her playing hideandseek with a little girl what i had a dream she was playing hideandseek with a little girl cassie and i do it all the time doesnt mean anything but was it cassie in the dream no where was she hiding  what  the little girl where was she hiding was it in a wardrobe no it was in a tall dresser you mean a wardrobe is that what thats called what color was it red were there horses on it oh boy its where i hid every time that we played it doesnt sound like you really got the gist of the game shes alive i knew it i knew it we need to get that part okay the sooner we get the tunnel working the sooner we can get this message out of his head does burch have it  yeah lets go  what part whos burch wait whats happening we need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again i grabbed your clothes you might want to change look id really like to help you but if im not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then im going away forever once we get the component and power up the tunnel well get the message and have you home by lunch we have to hurry the entanglement wont last you owe us all right fine but can i just wait inside because im not supposed to be out here lets go  we good  yeah ill be right back  can i have one of these  no ah susan welcome to oui sonny oui is french for yes as in yes to farmtotable yes to locally sourced and yes to planet before profit well lets hope it also means yes to do you have the component i ordered you know i have always loved your sense of humor susan have a seat no im good thank you who is this guy sonny burch he traffics in black market technology hes been getting us what we need to build the tunnel could i just have one no you know i have a special friend at the fbi and i say special because well he tells me things that i didnt previously know for example your name isnt susan its hope van dyne and your unseen associate thats your father hank pym  thats not good hank  no shit what do you want relationships are built on trust hope and i want our relationship to have a strong foundation our relationship my business landscape has been shifting hope hell shield and hydra dont even exist anymore but now hank pym hank pym is a real opportunity do you have a point oh you think that i dont know what youve been building with all this quantum technology now you can forget nanotech forget ai forget cryptocurrency quantum energy is the future its the next gold rush is that so i want in hope so as a gesture of good will i have taken the liberty of arranging some buyers for your lab starting bid one billion dollars thank you sonny really but my father and i have something slightly more pressing than starting a business so ill just take the component as arranged my buyers dont take no for an answer so we are either in business together or we arent in business together then i guess we arent you can go but im afraid your moneys gonna have to remain lets call it compensation for my injured feelings listen sonny this is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component darlin the only thing youre takin from here is my heart but it will mend in time okay so now what youll see she said her and her daddy had something pressing  mmmhmm  i want to know what it is because if theyre not working with us theyre working with somebody so find out i want some names hold on you gave her wings get her not my turnofthecentury chandelier stop firing stop all right take this go go go go go wings and blasters so i take it you didnt have that tech available for me no i did it was a pleasure doing business with you sonny oh our business isnt finished yet hope i can assure you of that what in the hell is that dad are you seeing this hope get out of there  i gotta do something  wait it is still a work in progress you taught me that kick remember yeah great form those were the days whatever happened to us not the time scott damn it whered it go ive lost it im not seeing anything on the ant cams try looking dad give me that now  are you okay  no he got the lab no come on what was that i dont know but we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is so where to now how about my house hmm im supposed to be there anyway and woo could walk in any second exactly why were not going to your house what about your house sorry well there is one place i can think of no no no no no no wow dr pym who wouldve thought that once again in your hour of need that you would turn to us you know not me mmm help yourself hey whats up with the fancy pastry we gotta keep the food budget down well what are we supposed to have for breakfast the oatmeal packets oatmeal packets  its insult  why is it an insult because it tastes like sand you know why cause its organic its not organic its sand its the most important meal of the day you know what you can get creative with it break teeth put a little brown sugar on it you can put some cinnamon put a little honey whatever you want guys guys guys come on man we got bigger fish to fry is that my desk  yeah  what why do i have such a small desk because you werent there when we were choosing desks you snooze you lose well i was under house arrest yeah you know what this isnt even a desk this is garbage you found this outside amongst garbage i got it at a rummage sale so you save money on my desk guys hope please we need to focus all right we gotta find that lab already jeez oh you know what i heard stories like what happened to you this crazy creepy cat who walks through walls and stuff like a ghost like baba yaga baba yaga the witch they tell stories to children to frighten them you know baba yaga whoever stole it we need to find it oh you dont find someone like that they find you like baba yaga dr pym youre the smartest genius i know didnt you put some kind of lojack on your lab because if you didnt we have a variety of affordable options of course i did luis it was disabled whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing they also looked like they were phasing phasing quantum phasing when an object moves through different states of matter oh yeah thats what i was thinking the lab emits radiation can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it that could work yes but all my equipment is in the lab where else can we find that equipment well there is one person bill foster great whos bill foster hes an old colleague of my dads from shield they had a falling out years ago you seem to have a lot of falling outs with people its probably just a waste of time hey im risking everything by being here dont you think we should check we need to find out who took the lab guys its not a good idea to be out in the open like this relax no ones gonna recognize us what because of hats and sunglasses thats not a disguise hank we look like ourselves at a baseball game in an isolated system particles coexist in a stable phase relationship if the system is interfered with that stability becomes chaos unpredictable dangerous beautiful isolated completely a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter each entangled with a distinct state of its environment in other words the object in question would be both in and out of phase with multiple parallel realities speaking of being out of phase with reality i am noticing an unusually high number of glazed eyes out there among you so why dont we call it a few minutes early thatll be enough for today thank you ladies and gentlemen you may go its incredible youre linked to janet its quantum entanglement between the quantum states of posner molecules in your brains yeah thats what i was thinking do you guys just put the word quantum in front of everything doctor we need to find our lab hope id love to help you but i dont have anything like the equipment youre describing i told you this is a waste of time come on lets go dont condescend hank youre the one whos on the run from the fbi all because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego that wasnt me in germany it was this idiot really going that big it mustve been exhausting i slept for three days straight you have no idea actually i do back in the day i was hanks partner on a project called goliath excuse me you were my partner the only thing more tiring than going that big is putting up with hanks bullshit right i dont know how big did you get my record  feet  not bad  you i dont no really im curious   feet yeah  whoa  huge   if you two are finished comparing sizes we need to figure out a way to track down the lab and the great hank pym hasnt figured that one out yet strange you had all the answers back in the day thats why i left the project left i fired you best decision i ever made hank was a terrible partner temperamental stubborn impatient sooner or later he just pushed everyone away just the mediocrities janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out watch it bill she paid the price though didnt she you son of a bitch i didnt come here to listen to you two squabble im trying to save my mother now which office would you say oh its woo someone must have seen me relax if this is about you theyd be in your house by now what are you  come on we gotta go right now wait you might be able to improvise that tracker if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators  that could work  i dont know what that means thank you thank you but doctor campus police says they idd both pym and van dyne i dont know what to tell you agent i havent talked to hank in  years i can assure you im the last person he would want to visit oh come on you expect us to hey hey why is that simple we hate each others guts so im a terrible partner foster he hasnt had one good idea in his unremarkable career but his idea about the diffractors could work right fine one decent idea except i eliminated the diffractors when i upgraded the suits so if we had an old suit we might be able to track down the lab yes but we dont  what if we did  what do you mean i mean lifes funny oh my god you didnt destroy the suit what well it was your lifes work hank i couldnt destroy that before i turned myself in i shrunk it down and mailed it to luis you sent my suit through the mail hey the postal service is very reliable you know they do tracking numbers now like ups where is it its in a very safe place all right dont worry what the trophy no its not here what do you mean its not there where could it be i looked everywhere its not here hey get away from the plant but i put it back after cassie and i showandtell scotty no stop well the good news is i know where it is whenever you go back to school isnt everything supposed to look so much smaller this place seems huge what is it its the new regulator hank whats going on with this suit how much of a work in progress is this uhoh no no no oh what are you laughing please could you just okay okay what do you see the sizing coils are malfunctioning just let me ow  sorry  its all right okay all right try that sorry what awesome if only cap could see you now hilarious what are we gonna do hey wheres your hall pass hey im talking to you hey hey eh you can do it you almost got it oh peanut okay lets go hiya champ how was school today all right get your jokes out now can you fix the suit so cranky you want a juice box and some string cheese do you really have that lets see if foster was right this has gotta be the lab lets go get it yeah this seems right look at us teaming up twice in one day makes you think huh about what germany what do you mean we were working together training together and other stuffing together if i had asked you would you have come i guess well never know but i do know one thing what if i had youd have never been caught hey scott you think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab  yes sir  thank you okay youre transmitting what took you so long sorry i had to come up with a name for my ant im thinking ulysses s grant you like it hilarious im not getting anything on the monitors theres some kind of electronic disturbance be careful you know me hank im always careful whoa its okay its just the suit  how do you know  look thats ghost what is she doing do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff lets just get outta here before she wakes up hope look theres the lab now were sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody elses right just take it scott come on we gotta be fast ill get it oh shit hope hope hank guys i dont think they can hear you hi im ava scott so you dont need the suit to go through things no it just helps me control it and the pain supposedly youre not gonna reach into my chest and crush my heart are you youre funny im not gonna hurt you scott unless i have to i need whats in your head lets wake up the rest of the gang and get this over with shall we get up come on dad dont ever touch him again now now hope i think im being rather gentle with your father all things considered what the hell are you talking about another casualty of hank pyms ego bill what have you done its what youve done dr pym youre with her oh man i thought you were cool what the hell is going on here i doubt hank has ever mentioned my father why would he elihas starr they were colleagues at shield quantum research until my father dare disagree with the great hank pym you had him fired oh and discredited for good measure my father tried to continue his research on his own desperate to restore his name so he took risks no no no too many until something went wrong he told us to run elihas whats happening just go go daddy daddy i could tell he was scared daddy ava no i didnt want him to be alone no no when i woke up my parents were dead i wasnt so lucky they call it molecular disequilibrium a rather dull name i think doesnt quite do justice to what it means every cell in my body is torn apart and stitched back together over and over every day i was still at shield when i got the call about a quantum anomaly in argentina hello ava my names bill i was a friend of your fathers i brought you something its all right try again thats it dr foster did his best to keep me safe but others at shield saw an opportunity in my affliction they built me a containment suit so i could control my phasing and trained me to be a stealth operative they weaponized me i stole for them spied for them killed for them and in exchange for my soul they were going to cure me they lied when shield collapsed i took ava in i built the chamber to slow her decay but her condition was progressive i didnt know how to cure it she wanted to kill you hank but i told her no and that she should watch you instead and sure enough she discovered that you were building the tunnel then she told me about lang and the message from janet inside his head thats when i christs sake thats me im sorry look can you tell me whos texting me cassie  thats my daughter i need to text her back no thats not happening what its  that means its an emergency youre not making demands here lang youre not appreciating the gravity of the okay look shes trying to video chat me now something might be wrong let me talk to her please cassie are you okay whats the emergency i cant find my soccer shoes what i have a game tomorrow hey scott i know that theyre there can you just walk the phone around the house no i cant do that right now  why not  because im sick hey can you just maybe look around later then and call me back please thank you bye daddy  bye peanut  feel better feel better buddy im sorry it said emergency ava i want to help you she doesnt need your help i know how to save her oh really how janet for the last  years shes been down there absorbing quantum energy we can extract that energy we can use it to repair avas molecular structure extract it  yes  are you insane that would rip janet apart you dont know that im gonna fire up your tunnel when janets location pops into langs head hes gonna give it to me or im gonna turn him over to the fbi what you are gonna stay here just in case i need your help like hell i would help you youll do whatever i say youre gonna kill janet id be more worried about yourself hank goddamn it bill  dad  calm down hank so help me god the pills its his heart he needs his pills please dr foster theyre in the tin please he could die come on help him dad just hang on all right just keep breathing stay calm help him man come on the altoid tin wait thanks guys hank bill is filling that girls head with lies elihas starr was a traitor he stole my plans now bring it down all right lock it in no no no the bolt is on the other side tighten that one down then bring it down one notch good job itll work foster he could have fried the entire system look well adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings all right its going to be fine so this is it yeah youd think with all this time to prepare id be more ready oh going subatomic isnt something you can prepare for it kind of melts your mind i mean seeing my mom again oh what if shes a completely different person yeah like uh george washington im serious scott or george jefferson what if shes forgotten about me when i was in prison the only thing that got me through was cassie i could have been locked up for  years i never would have forgotten her i know your mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again thank you hey we got a big problem you forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building oh no and theyre on the proposal and karapetyan asked for them specifically uh yeah look its been a little crazy look maybe i could stop by tomorrow take a look at it no no no no no the meeting is first thing in the morning you gotta come right now and fix it i cant i wish i could but i cant leave you know what im coming to you ill just bring the plans theyre on the laptop and you can fix them there just tell me where you are okay its complicated what do you mean its complicated as you can see sir this system is state of the art security of tomorrow today oh thats so good and i love the leanin bro keep practicin hey i just gotta drive up to scottys so we can fix the plans but dont worry ill be back in plenty of time  as you can see  oh oh oh tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning down to the undercarriage baby you sprung for the undercarriage wash well you said get the works thats a scam bro we live in california not minnesota hes right the undercarriage wash thats for cleaning off road salt laid down in our more snowladen sister states who are you and why do you know so much about car wash protocol well my name is sonny burch and i do my research luis to wit i have learned from a friend of mine at the fbi that you are a known associate of scott lang a known associate of hank pym who ive also learned has a portable shrinking laboratory filled with all kinds of juicy tech and youre gonna tell me where it is well i hate to break it to you but i dont know what youre talking about well i sense a resistance in you luis and i have promised results to some dangerous people so im gonna introduce you to my good friend uzman now uzman is a master at extracting information from the unwilling through psychoactive means oh is that truth serum theres no such thing as truth serum thats just nonsense from tv well what is it then its a little concoction that hes been perfecting since his days with the sis it makes you suggestible and highly responsive well dude thats truth serum no its not no offensing but they sound like truth serum to me  right  its not a truth serum okay hey i believe you its not a truth serum i mean if it walk like duck and talk like ducks the truth serum well i have a lot of allergies so you might wanna think about that weve got to get that lab back what the chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore how long have i got a couple of weeks maybe well then well make them bring the lab back how lang he has a daughter right you cant mean that ava i tolerate a lot of the things you do out there but i wont be a part of anything like that youre not the one whos about to fade away into nothing bill i am you said you could fix me you promised i know i will but not like that you lay one finger on that little girl i wont help you and were done fine there are other options you know what youre right this isnt truth serum because i dont feel anything that was a lie i do feel something this is truth serum theres no such thing okay okay okay now im gonna make this real easy for you luis okay where is scott lang well see thats complicated because when i first met scotty he was in a bad place and im not talkin about cell block d his wife had just filed for divorce and i was like damn homie she dumped you when youre on lockup and he was like yeah i know i thought i was gonna be with her forever but now im all alone and i was like damn homie you know what you gotta chin up because youll find a new partner but you know what im luis and he says you know what im scotty and were gonna be best friends okay hold on hold on i like a good story as much as the next person but what in the hell does this have to do with where scott lang is im getting there im getting there you put a dime in him you gotta let the whole song play out he like human jukebox oh my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant yeah only played morrissey and if anybody ever complained shed be like you know chicanos we call him moz then âadios what can i say we relate to his melancholy ballads you know  lang  right right right so anyway scotty gets out of jail and he starts working for hank thats when he met hope and hopes all like i want nothing to do with you look at my hairdo im

over just like that bullseye source lock its you we got it you have to meet me at these exact coordinates in the wasteland beyond the quantum void its very dangerous especially on the human mind so be careful time and space work very differently down here you have two hours after that the probability fields will shift and itll be another century before they align like this again well find you i know you will jellybean nope nothing i got nothing no sign of janet perfect how did we get up here all right first youre gonna see all kinds of lights and its gonna get really trippy but then its

quit screwing around you told me yourself not to screw around hank hope janet guys guys okay seriously dont joke around bring me up lets go guysbaba yes my son tell me a story which one the story of home millions of years ago a meteorite made of vibranium the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of africa  affecting the plant life around it and when the time of man came five tribes settled on it and called it wakanda the tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the panther goddess bast who led him to the heartshaped herb a plant that granted him superhuman strength speed and instincts the warrior became king and the first black panther the protector of wakanda four tribes agreed to live under the kings rule but the jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains the wakandans used vibranium to develop technology more advanced than any other nation but as wakanda thrived the world around it descended further into chaos to keep vibranium safe the wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight keeping the truth of their power from the outside world and we still hide baba yes boy why  lucky shot  that aint lucky

how to best protect wakanda i want to be a great king baba just like you youre going to struggle so youll need to surround yourself with people you trust youre a good man with a good heart and its hard for a good man to be king breathe tchalla breathe breathe he was there he was there my father just one come home nana im right here sta i came to support you and to honor your father but i cant stay i found my calling out there ive seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye i cant be happy here knowing that theres people out there who have nothing what would you have wakanda do about it share what we have we could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it other countries do it we could do it better we are not like these other countries nakia if the world found out what we truly are what we possess we could lose our way of life wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time if you were not so stubborn you would make a great queen i would make a great queen because i am so stubborn  see you admit it  if thats what i wanted is that him glory to bast man is he still growing of course i see nakia is back you guys going to work it out tchalla whats wrong nakia thinks we should be doing more more like what foreign aid refugee programs you let the refugees in they bring their problems with them and then wakanda is like everywhere else now if you said you wanted me and my men to go out there and clean up the world then ill be all for it but waging war on other countries has never been our way you too bast were in trouble my king my love you will never guess who just popped up on our radar a misidentified wakandan artifact was stolen yesterday from a british museum we have learned ulysses klaue plans to sell the vibranium to an american buyer in south korea tomorrow night klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost  years not capturing him is perhaps my fathers greatest regret i wish to bring klaue back here to stand trial wakanda does not need a warrior right now we need a king my parents were killed when he attacked not a day goes by when i do not think about what klaue took from us from me its too great an opportunity to pass take me with you well take him down together side by side i need you here protecting the border then i ask you kill him where he stands or you bring him back to us you have my word i will bring him back we will proceed with the mission my king stop it stop it ive already sent a car ahead to busan for you who are you taking with you to korea okoye and nakia as well you sure its a good idea to take your ex on a mission yes well be fine besides youll be on call should we need backup yes i have great things to show you brother here are your communication devices for korea unlimited range also equipped with audio surveillance system check these out remote access kimoyo beads updated to interface directly with my sand table tchallai and what are these the real question is what are those why do you have your toes out in my lab what you dont like my royal sandals i wanted to go old school for my first day i bet the elders loved that try them on fully automated like the old american movie baba used to watch and i made them completely sound absorbent interesting guess what i call them sneakers because you never mind if youre going to take on klaue youll need the best the design group has to offer exhibit a  my design  old tech  old  functional but old hey people are shooting at me wait let me put on my helmet enough now look at these do you like that one tempting but the idea is to not be noticed this one now tell it to go on shurii ooh the entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace strike it anywhere not that hard genius you told me to strike it you didnt say how hard i invite you to my lab and you just kick things around well maybe you should make it a little stronger hey wait a minute the nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribution very nice strike it again in the same spot youre recording for research purposes delete that footage this way bast willing this will go quickly and i can get this ridiculous thing off my head it looks nice just whip it back and forth what its a disgrace hello sophia good to see you who are these two my friends from kenya very deep pockets theyre good good

am interested in is that arm cannon out there whered you get that its an old mining tool that i made some adjustments to but i can get you one if you like why dont you give me the name of your supplier and ill ask them hes right outside why dont you ask him yourself what tchalla youre telling me that weapon on your arm is from wakanda bingo what do you actually know about wakanda um shepherds textiles cool outfits its all a front explorers searched for it for centuries el dorado the golden city they thought they could find it in south america but it was in africa the whole time a technological marvel all because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man isipho they call it the gift vibranium vibranium yeah strongest metal on earth its not just a metal they sew it into their clothes it powers their city their tech their weapons weapons yeah makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower thats a nice fairy tale but wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium i stole all of it i took a tiny piece of it they have a mountain full of it theyve been mining it for thousands of years and they still havent scratched the surface im the only outsider whos seen it and got out of there alive if you dont believe me you ask your friend what his suit is made of what his claws are made of your father told the un that klaue stole all the vibranium you had but now hes telling me you have more and you believe the word of an arms dealer strapped to a chair where is that back there how much more are you hiding something is happening out back get down stand down cover grenade i see you took your time didnt you my king my king nana he justjumped in front of me i dont think hell make it here it hit his spine give me a kimoyo bead this will stabilize him for now give him to us we can save him our mission was to bring back klaue we failed this man is a foreign intelligence operative how do we justify bringing him into our borders he took a bullet for me that was his choice so now we are just supposed to let him die let us consider that we heal him it is his duty to report back to his country and as king it is your duty to protect ours im well aware of my duties general i cannotjust let him die knowing we can save him where exactly are we taking him great another broken white boy for us to fix this is going to be fun

he helped klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring my grandfathers ring do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth some truths are too much to bear tchalla that is not your choice to make what happened to him i promised the king to say nothing i am your king now your uncle took a war dog assignment in america your father placed me there to observe unbeknownst to him your uncle fell in love with an american woman they had a child the hardships he saw there radicalized your uncle i observed for as long as i could their leaders have been assassinated communities flooded with drugs and weapons they are overly policed and incarcerated all over the planet our people suffer because they dont have the tools to fight back with vibranium weapons they could overthrow every country and wakanda could rule them all the right way he knew your father would not support this so your uncle betrayed us no he helped klaue steal the vibranium no no no you will return home at once where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes he drew his weapon on me no your father killed his own brother to save my life speak nothing of this and the child we left him we had to

the first aid kit do me a favor and dont be dead please where did he come from odin once mankind accepted a simple truth that they were not alone in this universe some worlds man believed to be home to their gods others they knew to fear from a realm of cold and darkness came the frost giants screams threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age roars but humanity would not face this threat alone yelling our armies drove the frost giants back into the heart of their own world the cost was great in the end their king fell and the source of their power was taken from them with the last great war ended we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home to the realm eternal asgard here we remain as a beacon of hope shining out across the stars and though we have fallen into mans myths and legends it was asgard and its warriors that brought peace to the universe but the day will come when one of you will have to defend that peace do the frost giants still live when im king ill hunt the monsters down and slay them all just as you did father a wise king never seeks out war but he must always be ready for it  im ready father  so am i only one of you can ascend to the throne but both of you were born to be kings all cheering oh please spear thudding thor odinson my heir my firstborn so long entrusted with the mighty hammer mjolnir forged in the heart of a dying star its power has no equal as a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build tis a fit companion for a king i have defended asgard and the lives of the innocent across the nine realms from the time of the great beginning though the day has come do you swear to guard the nine realms i swear and do you swear to preserve the peace i swear do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms i swear then on this day i odin allfather proclaim you the frost giants spear thudding thor the jotuns must pay for what theyve done they have paid with their lives the destroyer did its work the casket is safe and all is well all is well they broke into the weapons vault if the frost giants had stolen even one of these relics  they didnt  well i want to know why i have a truce with laufey king of the jotuns he just broke your truce they know you are vulnerable what action would you take march into jotunheim as you once did teach them a lesson break their spirits so theyll never dare try to cross our borders again youre thinking only as a warrior this was an act of war it was the act of but a few doomed to fail look how far they got we will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed as king of asgard but youre not king not yer roaring its unwise to be in my company right now brother this was to be my day of triumph itll come in time whats this if its any consolation i think youre right about the frost giants about laufey about everything if they found a way to penetrate asgards defenses once whos to say they wont try again  next

show you how silly his story was but youre the one whos always pushing me to chase down every possibility every alternative im talking about science not magic well magics just science that we dont understand yet  arthur c clarke  who wrote science fiction  a precursor to science fact  in some cases yeah well if there is an einsteinrosen bridge then theres something on the other side and advanced beings could have crossed it jane a primitive culture like the vikings might have worshipped them as deities yes yes exactly thank you mmmhmm sighs coulson you made my men some of the most highly trained professionals in the world look like a bunch of minimumwage mall cops thats hurtful in my experience it takes someone whos received similar training to do what you did to them why dont you tell me where you received your training pakistan chechnya afghanistan no you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type where was it south africa certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you who are you one way or another we find out what we need to know were good at that pager beeping dont go anywhere loki what are you doing here i had to see you whats happened tell me is it jotunheim let me explain to father father is dead what your banishment the threat of a new war it was too much for him to bear you mustnt blame yourself i know that you loved him i tried to tell him so but he wouldnt listen it was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach knowing that you could never lift it the burden of the throne has fallen to me now can i come home the truce with jotunheim is conditional upon your exile  yes but couldnt we find a way  and mother has forbidden your return this is goodbye brother im so sorry no i am sorry thank you for coming here farewell goodbye good bye i just got back static crackling mjolnir humming sir hes got a visitor his name is donald blake dr donald blake you have dangerous coworkers dr selvig he was distraught when he found out that youve taken all our research that was years of his life gone you can understand how a man could go off like that a big faceless organization like yours coming in with their jackbooted thugs and thats how he put it that still doesnt explain how he managed to tear through our security steroids hes a bit of a fitness nut alarm beeps technician sir it says here that hes an md well he is or he was he switched careers and became a physicist a brilliant physicist hes a wonderful man hes a man in pain erik oh donny donny donny there you are youre gonna be all right im taking you home now coulson dr selvig just keep him away from the bars i will  where are we going  to get a drink follow them you know i had it all backwards i had it all wrong its not a bad thing finding out that you dont have all the answers you start asking the right questions for the first time in my life i have no idea what im supposed to do anyone whos ever going to find his way in this world has to start by admitting he doesnt know where the hell he is thank you for what youve done no dont thank me i only did it for jane her father and i taught at university together he was a good man he never listened neither did i my father was trying to teach me something but i was too stupid to see it i dont know if youre delusional or if youre pulling some kind of con i dont care i just care about her ive seen the way she looks at you i swear to you i mean her no harm good in that case ill buy you another round and you leave town tonight two boilermakers laufey kill him after all ive done for you so youre the one who showed us the way into asgard that was just a bit of fun really to ruin my brothers big day and to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer i will hear you i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers lead you into odins chambers and you can slay him where he lies why not kill him yourself snorts i suspect that the asgardians would not take kindly to a king who had murdered his predecessor once odin is dead i will return the casket to you and you can return jotunheim to all its glory  accept what troubles you gatekeeper i turned my gaze upon you in jotunheim but could neither see you nor hear you you were shrouded from me like the frost giants that entered this realm perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see you have great power heimdall did odin ever fear you  no  and why is that because he is my king and i am sworn to obey him he was your king and youre sworn to obey me now yes yes then you will open the bifrost to no one until i have repaired the damage that my brother has done banging on door gasps oh my god is he okay hes fine not injured at all groans  im sorry my friend  what happened  we drank we fought he made his ancestors proud put him on the bed groans laughing i still dont think youre the god of thunder but you ought to be are these your chambers its more of a temporary living situation im sorry i dont usually have guests actually i never have guests thats not the right place for it im sorry can we go outside yes of course i come up here sometimes when i cant sleep or im trying to reconcile particle data or when darcys driving me crazy i come up here a lot actually now that i think about it im really glad youre safe youve been very kind to me and ive been far less grateful than you deserve well i hit you with my car a couple times so i think that kind of evens things out perhaps i had it coming oh my god i dont believe it it was all i could get back im sorry its not as much as i promised no no this is great this is i dont have to start from scratch now thank you whats wrong shleld whatever they are theyre gonna do everything in their power to make sure this research never sees the light of day no jane listen to me you must not give up  you must finish what youve started  why because youre right here look your ancestors called it magic and you call it science well i come from a place where theyre one and the same thing what is that my father explained it to me like this that your world is one of the nine realms of the cosmos linked to each other by the branches of yggdrasil the worlds tree now you see it every day without realizing the images glimpsed through what did you call it this hooble telescope  hubble  hubble telescope laughs tell me more so the nine realms now there is midgard which is earth this is alfheim vanaheim jotunheim and asgard and thats where i come from thank you jane fandral our dearest friend banished loki on the throne asgard on the brink of war yet youve managed to consume four wild boar six pheasant a side of beef and two casks of ale shame on you dont you care do not mistake my appetite for apathy stop it both of you stop  we all know what we have to do  we must go we must find thor its treason to hell with treason its suicide thor would do the same for us now shush heimdall might be watching doors opening heimdall demands your presence volstagg were doomed you would defy the commands of loki our king break every oath you have taken as warriors and commit treason to bring thor back  yes  good so youll help us i am bound by honor to our king i cannot open the bridge to you complicated fellow isnt he now what do we do look  what the hell was that  i dont know sir we got massive energy readings out of nowhere and then they just disappeared fifteen miles due northwest lets go take a look thank you  thank you  youre very welcome

this is good this is good i dont believe it oh excuse me lady sif and the warriors three my friends ive never been happier to see anyone but you should not have come were here to take you home you know i cant go home my father is dead because of me and i must remain in exile thor your father still lives tell me loki how did you get the jotuns into asgarol you think the bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm there are secret paths between the worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind but i have need of them no longer now that i am king and i say for your act of treason you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper and no longer citizen of asgard then i need no longer obey you get somebody from linguistics down here thunder crashing people murmuring people

what theyve done today thor loki thor i knew youd return to us why dont you tell her how you sent the destroyer to kill our friends to kill me what why it must have been enforcing fathers last command youre a talented liar brother always have been its good to have you back now if youll excuse me i have to destroy jotunheim loki you cant stop it the bifrost will build until it rips jotunheim apart frost giants screaming jane why have you done this to prove to father that i am the worthy son when he wakes i will have saved his life i will have destroyed that race of monsters and i will be true heir to the throne you cant kill an entire race why not and what is this newfound love for the frost giants you could have killed them all with your bare hands  ive changed  so have i now fight me i

never see her again forgive me jane both yelling i could have done it father i could have done it for you for all of us no loki loki no no no jane its gone all laughing and then with a mighty bellow i flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low fandral is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass volstagg as a matter of fact falling was a tactic lulling the destroyer my queen im so sorry for your loss frigga how is he sif he mourns for his brother and he misses hen the mortal youll be a wise king there will never be a wiser king than you or a better father i have much to learn i know that now someday perhaps i shall make you proud youve already made me proud so earth is lost to us no there is always hope can you see her heimdall laughs yes erik i have the particle detectors darcy do you have the shield satellite codes darcy yeah have you seen my taser thor how is she erik in the car come on jane heimdall she searches for you nick fury dr selvig so youre the man behind all this its quite a labyrinth i was thinking theyre taking me down here to kill me ive been hearing about the new mexico situation your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than i am i have a lot to work with the foster theory a gateway to another dimension its unprecedented isnt it legend tells us one thing history another but every now and then we find something that belongs to both what is it power doctor if we can figure out how to tap it maybe unlimited power well i guess thats worth a look well i guess thats worth a looklong before the birth of light there was darkness and from that darkness came the dark elves millennia ago the most ruthless of their kind malekith sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night such evil was possible through the power of the aether an ancient force of infinite destruction malekith asgards forces are upon us the noble armies of asgard led by my father king bor waged a mighty war against these creatures send in the cursed as the nine worlds converged above him malekith could at last unleash the aether ahh but asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp without it the dark elves fell with the battle all but lost malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to asgards army their deaths will mean our survival this war is far from over malekith was vanquished and the aether was no more or so we were led to believe sire the aether shall we destroy it if only we could but its power is too great bury it deep somewhere no one will ever find it loki hello mother have i made you proud please dont make this worse define worse enough i will speak to the prisoner alone i really dont see what all the fuss is about do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes wherever you go there is war ruin and death i went down to midgard to rule the people of earth as a benevolent god just like you we are not gods we are born we live we die just as humans do give or take  years all this because loki desires a throne it is my birthright your birthright was to die as a child cast out onto a frozen rock if i had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me if i am for the axe then for mercys sake just swing it its not that i dont love our little talks its just i dont love them frigga is the only reason youre still alive and you will never see her again you will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons and what of thor youll make that witless oaf king while i rot in chains thor must strive to undo the damage you have done he will bring order to the nine realms and then yes he will be king  ah ive got this completely under control is that why everything is on fire ah youre welcome ha all yours hello i accept your surrender anyone else perhaps next time we should start with the big one keep moving come on keep moving go ahead of me dont you turn around where do we go next hogan the peace is nearly won across the nine realms you should stay here be with your people where your heart is asgard can wait you have my thanks as you have mine heimdall when youre ready is vanaheim secure as are nornheim and ria though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore you must think im a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily that was not my intent for the first time since bifrost was destroyed the nine realms are at peace theyre well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude thank you nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart this isnt about jane foster father human lives are fleeting theyre nothing youd be better served by what lies in front of you im telling you this not as the allfather but as your father you are ready the time has come for you to take the throne embrace and celebrate what youve won join your warriors eat and drink revel in their celebration at least pretend to enjoy yourself another there was a time when you would celebrate for weeks i remember you celebrated the battle of harokin so much that you nearly started the second well the first was so much fun take a drink with me surely the allfather could have no further task for you tonight no this is one i set myself it does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night there are nine realms the future king of asgard must focus on more than one i thank you for your sword and for your counsel good lady hi hi so whats the story with you why does there have to be a story theres no story you spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it its either chicken vegetarian or fish jane i think theres a story and im thinking the story involves a guy its complicated is he still around no he went away ive been there the going away its hard isnt it i was seeing a woman and she took a job in new york eventually the distance killed it and the fact that she kept sleeping with other dudes  no  oh so many hi could we get some wine please sure id love some richard this is darcy what are you doing here oh hello so i show up to work at the lab your moms house fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas eating ice cream and obsessing about you know who ah but youre not youre wearing lady clothes you even showered didnt you you smell good is there a point to all this because there really needs to be a point to all this right you know all that scientific equipment you dont look at anymore you might want to start looking at it again this is the reason we came all the way out here its malfunctioning thats what i said thats what i did i thought you would do something a little more scientific  im sure its nothing  yeah its it doesnt look like nothing it kind of looks like the readings that erik was rambling about our friend erik kind of went banana balls hes not interested  im not interested  im interested its time for you to go now okay short but sweet she needs help i think im going to have the sea bass sea bass yeah sea bass is good sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass sea bass jane maybe you should stop saying sea bass and go after your friend this was so fun ill just stay here and say sea bass alone and i hate you what i said he was cute just shut up and drive  you need to take the next left  whos he  hes my intern  you have an intern  oh yeah hello dr foster its such a great honor to be working with you right i have to call erik oh take a right and a left i have totally mastered driving in london hi erik its me again where are you i came here because you said you were onto something and then you vanish im here at stonehenge for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today the police were called to the scene shortly after  am this morning after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then decided to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment whilst shouting that he was trying to save them the man later identified as noted astrophysicist dr erik selvig has been called in for questioning by police come on this is exciting look the intern is excited ian do you want the phase meter  no  bring the phase meter the toasterlooking thing yeah i know what the phase meter is how do i change the ringtone on this thing an astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ringtone why are you calling me i didnt want to shout intern says its this way  ian my name is ian  shh i am not getting stabbed in the name of science its okay were americans is that supposed to make them like us  theyll make it go away  shh oh theyre kids are you the police no were scientists well i am thanks we just found it can you show us that doesnt seem right whered it go thats thats incredible what happened sometimes they come back sometimes they dont i want to throw something jane give me your shoe i havent seen readings like this since since new mexico dont touch anything give me your shoe oh were those the car keys whoa ah oh darcy oh the aether awakens us the convergence returns youre late merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle then youre doing one of them incorrectly perhaps how fare the stars heimdall still shining from here i can see nine realms and ten trillion souls do you recall what i taught you of the convergence yes the alignment of the worlds it approaches doesnt it the universe hasnt seen this marvel since before my watch began few can sense it even fewer can see it but while its effects can be dangerous it is truly beautiful i see nothing or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek how is she shes quite clever your mortal she doesnt know it yet but she studies the convergence as well even what i cant see her jane where the hell were you tell me you didnt call the police what was i supposed to do  not call the police  i was freaking out you call the cops they call the feds next thing you know we have shield crawling all over  area ing the place  jane we had a stable gravitation anomaly we had unimpeded access our only competition was ten years old jane you were gone for five hours what thats weird typical jane sorry i just needed to make sure you were real its been a very strange day i am jane what where were you where were you heimdall cannot see you i was right here where you left me i was waiting and then i was crying and then i went out looking for you you said you were coming back i know i know but the bifrost was destroyed the nine realms erupted into chaos wars were raging marauders were pillaging i had to put an end to the slaughter as excuses go its not terrible but i saw you on tv you were in new york jane i fought to protect you from the dangers of my world but i was wrong i was a fool but i believe that fate brought us together jane i dont know where you were or what happened but i do know this what i know you do do what what hey is this you uh were kind of in the middle of something here um im pretty sure we are getting arrested hold that thought look at you still all muscly and everything hows space space is fine excuse me  are you jane foster  yes do you know this man hes my intern my interns intern this is private property and youre trespassing the lot of you youll have to come with me jane  jane  thor are you all right what just happened place your hands on your heads step back this woman is unwell shes dangerous so am i requesting armed response officers to scene  hold on to me  what are you doing holy shit we have to do that again hi welcome to asgard look upon my legacy algrim i can barely remember a time before the light our survival will be your legacy the asgardians will suffer as we have suffered i will reclaim the aether i will restore our world and i will put an end to this poisoned universe whats that be still this is not of earth what is it we do not know but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her thats a quantum field generator isnt it its a soul forge does a soul forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another yes quantum field generator my words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely she is ill she is mortal illness is their defining trait i brought her here because we can help her she does not belong here in asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet table did he just who do you think you are i am odin king of asgard protector of the nine realms oh well im i know very well who you are jane foster you told your dad about me something is within her father something i have not seen before her world has its healers they are called doctors let them deal with it guards take her back to midgard no i would not touch her jane are you all right yeah its impossible the infection its defending her no its defending itself come with me there are relics that predate the universe itself what lies within her appears to be one of them the nine realms are not eternal they had a dawn as they will have a dusk but before that dawn the dark forces the dark elves reigned absolute and unchallenged born of eternal night the dark elves come to steal away the light i know these stories mother told them to us as children their leader malekith made a weapon out of that darkness and it was called the aether while the other relics often appear as stones the aether is fluid and ever changing it changes matter into dark matter it seeks out host bodies drawing strength from their lifeforce malekith sought to use the aethers power to return the universe to one of darkness but after eternities of bloodshed my father bor finally triumphed ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years what happened he killed them all are you certain the aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is the dark elves are dead does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me no it does not the worlds are nearly aligned you will be the last of the kursed let my life be sacrificed it is no less than our people did or you have done you will become darkness cursed to this existence until it consumes you until then no power our enemies possess can stop you i will tear down their defenses and ensure your return to a universe reborn acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us oh please if they were beneath you my rotund friend theyd all be dead  keep in line  move it odin continues to bring me new friends how thoughtful the books i sent do they not interest you is that how i am to while away eternity reading ive done everything in my power to make you comfortable loki have you does odin share your concern does thor it must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night you know full well it was your actions that brought you here my actions i was merely giving truth to the lie that i had been fed my entire life that i was born to be a king a king a true king admits his faults what of the lives you took on earth a mere handful compared to the number that odin has taken himself  your father  hes not my father then am i not your mother youre not youre always so perceptive about everyone but yourself when you came for me you knew i was in trouble heimdall had lost sight of you you were no longer on earth how is that possible i believe you were and you werent the nine realms travel within yggdrasil orbiting midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun and every  years the worlds align perfectly and we call this the convergence during this time the borders between worlds become blurred its possible you found one of these points we are lucky that it remained open once the worlds pass out of alignment then the connection is lost i like the way you explain things whats going to happen to me ill find a way to save you jane  your father said there was  my father doesnt know everything dont let him hear you say that jane foster please meet frigga queen of asgard and my mother hi move to the dungeons come on you might want to take the stairs to the left the prisons  loki  go i will look after her its as if they resent being imprisoned  theres no pleasing some creatures return to your cells no further harm will come to you you have my word very well you do not have my word send a squadron to the weapons vault defend it at all costs secure the dungeon  odin  frigga go its a skirmish nothing to fear youve never been a very good liar take her to your chambers ill come for you when its safe you take care despite all i have survived my queen still worries over me its only because i worry over you that you have survived listen to me now i need you to do everything i ask no questions yes maam oh  ow  ah the throne of asgard is destroyed to the king frigga stand down creature and you may still survive this i have survived worse woman who are you i am malekith and i would have what is mine ah you have taken something child give it back witch where is the aether ill never tell you i believe you no the universe rotates on a  year cycle and once a cycle all the worlds align imagine imagine that this is our world oh thank you and this is another world normally theyre separate but during the alignment everything is connected all nine realms all nine realms are passing through each other and gravity light and even matter is crashing from one world to the other but if this happens to us now the result will be cataclysmic my gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the convergence this time the alignment and all the other worlds would just pass us by its beautiful its simple any questions yeah can i have my shoe back heal you will need your strength to reclaim the aether and when you wake we will kill them all jane foster you need to come with us we are still unable to restore the palace shields our artillery cannot detect them even heimdall cannot see them my king we are all but defenseless shes your prisoner now leave us i do not wish to fight with you nor i with you but i intend to pursue malekith we possess the aether malekith will come to us yes and he will destroy us you overestimate the power of these creatures no i value our peoples lives ill take jane to the dark world and draw the enemy away from asgard when malekith pulls the aether from jane it will be exposed and vulnerable and i will destroy it and him if you fail you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies the risk is far greater if we do nothing his ship could be over our heads right now we would never even know it if and when he comes his men will fall on  asgardian blades and how many of our men shall fall on theirs as many as are needed ah we will fight till the last asgardian breath till the last drop of asgardian blood then how are you different from malekith the difference my son is that i will win jane isnt calling me back erik isnt calling me back stupid shield isnt calling me back  whats shield  its a secret hey erik its darcy again thor came back he took jane to asgard and im not sure what im supposed to do something else went missing this week when astrophysicist dr erik selvig notable for his involvement in the alien invasion of new york streaked nude across darcy you really need to look at this your friend erik what was his last name again and began shouting at visitors to the historic site he was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation police are still refusing to confirm you were not at odins war council the bifrost is closed by your fathers orders no one is to come or to go we face an enemy that is invisible even to me what use is a guardian such as that malekith will return you know this i need your help i cannot overrule my kings wishes not even for you im not asking you to the realms need their allfather strong and unchallenged whether he is or not but he is blinded heimdall by hatred and by grief as are we all i see clearly enough the risks are too great everything we do from here on is a risk there is no other way what do you require of me what im about to ask of you is treason of the highest order success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death malekith knew the aether was here he can sense its power if we do nothing he will come for it again but this time lay waste to all of asgard we must move jane offworld the bifrost has been shut down and the tesseract locked away in the vault there are other paths off asgard ways known only to a few one actually no thor after all this time and now you come to visit me why have you come to gloat to mock loki enough no more illusions now you see me brother did she suffer i did not come here to share our grief instead i offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament go on i know you seek vengeance as much as i do you help me escape asgard and i will grant it to you vengeance and afterward this cell you must be truly desperate to come to me for help what makes you think you can trust me i dont mother did but you should know that when we fought each other in the past i did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere that hope no longer exists to protect you you betray me and i will kill you hmm when do we start he will betray you he will try this is so unlike you brother so clandestine are you sure you wouldnt rather just punch your way out if you keep speaking i just might fine as you wish im not even here is this better its better company at least still we could be less conspicuous mmm brother you look ravishing it will hurt no less when i kill you in this form very well perhaps you prefer one of your new companions given that you seem to like them so much oh this is much better ooh the costume is a bit much so tight but the confidence i can feel the righteousness surging hey do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth honor patriotism god bless amer what you could at least furnish me with a weapon my dagger something at last a little common sense and i thought you liked tricks well what then your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of einherjar who will see you coming from miles away i wont be the one who comes for her im not hungry what the good lets go youre im loki you may have heard of me that was for new york i like her and what of the allfather it is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne you called me here on an urgent matter what is it treason my lord whose mine my king the mortal has been taken stop thor by any means necessary there they are take them on my command ill hold them off take her thank you betray him and ill kill you its good to see you too sif assuming you can get lokis help and you can free this mortal what good would it do wed all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace that my friend is why we wont be leaving by foot i will give you as much time as i can thank you my friend if you even think about betraying him youll kill me evidently there will be a line i thought you said you knew how to fly this thing i said how hard could it be theyre on the ship get to the ship well whatever youre doing brother i suggest you do it faster  shut up loki you must have missed something no i didnt im pressing every button on this thing no dont hit it just press it gently im pressing it gently its networking ha ha get him get him  i think you missed a column  shut up look why dont you

at us yeah thank you for the commentary loki its not at all distracting well done you just decapitated your grandfather you know this is wonderful this is a tremendous idea lets steal the biggest most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that flying around the city smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us its brilliant thor its truly brilliant i see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful loki you lied to me im impressed im glad youre pleased now do as you promised and take us to your secret pathway  fandral  right for asgard nothing personal boys loki if it were easy everyone would do it  are you mad  possibly lon yaden we must strike now no asgard is meaningless the aether has found its way home what i could do with the power that flows through those veins it would consume you shes holding up all right for now shes strong in ways youd never even know say goodbye not this day this day the next a hundred years its nothing its a heartbeat youll never be ready the only woman whose love youve prized will be snatched from you and will that satisfy you satisfaction is not in my nature surrender is not in mine  the son of odin  no not just of odin you

sorry  shh its okay its all right ill tell father what you did here today i didnt do it for him no hes going to unleash it not just on asgard or on a star malekith is going to destroy everything how jane how i saw him on earth why would he go to earth the convergence oh god none of this would have happened if i hadnt found the aether then malekith wouldve only possessed it that much sooner i only found it because i was looking for you jane now were trapped here its not me hello hi jane its richard richard where are you im still at the office its been a crazy day here today  oh my god this is amazing  is it i quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything how am i getting service here is this a bad time do you want me to try you later no no no please whatever you do do not hang up the phone okay then i was just wondering if you want to try again uh maybe dinner next time uh yeah yeah yeah  just stay on the phone okay  yeah i will on my god am i interrupting something no no no nothing at all come on im losing you there are you in a tunnel where are we going hello why are there so many shoes in here ill just text her so whos richard really  jane  hey you cant just leave like that the whole world is going crazy all the stuff we saw is spreading  did you go to a party  erik jane how wonderful oh  youve been to asgard  where are your pants oh he uh he says it helps him think okay well im going to need everything you got on this all the work youve been doing on gravimetric anomalies everything okay  are you well erik your brothers not coming is he loki is dead oh thank god i i meant im so sorry thank you forgive me my liege ive returned from the dark world with news thor there was no sign of thor or the weapon but what we found a body loki malekith is going to fire the aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connecting amplifying the weapons impact for each additional world the power will increase exponentially the effect would be universal but the alignment is only temporary he must be in exactly the right place at the right time well how do we know where that is we follow the directions this has happened before thousands of years ago and the ancients were there to see it all the great constructions the mayans the chinese the egyptians they made use of the gravitational effects of the convergence and they left us a map stonehenge snowdon the great orme these are all coordinates taking us here greenwich the walls between worlds will be almost nonexistent physics is going to go ballistic increases and decreases in gravity spatial extrusions the very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart i better get my pants focus this is important we have to hammer them in all around the site and then jane and erik will activate them from the tower theyre taped together do you even know what these things do uh no neither do i shh  come on come on come on  right holy shit ah you neednt have come so far asgardian death wouldve come to you soon enough not by your hand your universe was never meant to be your world and your family will be extinguished were running out of time  almost there  are you sure this is going to work these devices were made to detect anomalies not cause them oh come on come on darcy you know with all that power i thought youd hit harder done the convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes that just means we have to keep malekith busy for eight okay you might want to hold on to something that is awesome how did you do that well the gravitational fields interact with the weak spots between worlds creating ooh get the guy with the sword  oops  lets go um  what the hell just happened move what are you all doing you need to get out of here now youre joking right thats thor out there hes waving his hammer around and everything ah confirming ship is hostile confirmed ship is hostile you have permission to engage roger missiles locked missiles away missiles off target i repeat target missed im losing control mayday mayday lost positive control what are you doing my signals not connecting jane come on are you all right you saved my life yeah i guess i did mmm darcy  jane  ian  selvig mew mew mind the gap how do i get to greenwich take this train three stops mind the gap sorry sorry  were out of time  jane jane thor were too late the convergence is at its peak can those things stop him not from here we cant get close enough i can malekith darkness returns asgardian have you come to witness the end of your universe ive come to accept your surrender you think you can stop this the aether cannot be destroyed but you can thor no jane ah everybody okay hes gonna come back except you know last time he was gone for like two years well its only been two days so did he say anything before he left yeah he had to figure some stuff out with his father he kinda committed treason on our way out oh you once said there would never be a wiser king than me you were wrong the alignment has brought all the realms together every one of them saw you offer your life to save them what can asgard offer its new king in return my life father i cannot be king of asgard i will protect asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath but i cannot do so from that chair loki for all his grave imbalance understood rule as i know i never will the brutality the sacrifice it changes you id rather be a good man than a great king is this my son i hear or the woman he loves when you speak do i never hear mothers voice this is not for jane father she does not know what i came here to say now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side it changes nothing one son who wanted the throne too much another who will not take it is this my legacy loki died with honor i shall try to live the same is that not legacy enough it belongs to you if you are worthy of it i shall try to be i cannot give you my blessing nor can i wish you good fortune i know if i were proud of the man my son had become even that i could not say it would speak only from my heart go my son thank you father no thank you i present to you taneleer tivan the collector whoa asgardians its an honor you know why were here of course but if i may ask why not keep it secure in your own vault the tesseract is already on asgard it is not wise to keep two infinity stones so close together thats very wise i can assure you it will be absolutely safe here in my collection see that it is one down five to goon your left on your left on my left got it dont say it dont you say it  on your left  come on need a medic i need a new set of lungs dude you just ran like  miles in  minutes i guess i got a late start really you should be ashamed of yourself you should take another lap did you just take it i

awesome in front of the girl at the front desk just let me know  ill keep it in mind  yeah hey fellas either one of you know where the smithsonian is im here to pick up a fossil thats hilarious  how you doing  hey cant run everywhere no you cant target is a mobile satellite launch platform the lemurian star they were sending up their last payload when pirates took them  minutes ago  any demands  billion and a half  why so steep  because its shields so its not offcourse its trespassing im sure they have a good reason you know im getting a little tired of being furys janitor relax its not that complicated how many pirates  top mercs led by this guy georges batroc exdgse action division hes at the top of interpols red notice before the french demobilized him he had  kill missions this guys got a rep for maximum casualties hostages mostly techs one officer jasper sitwell theyre in the galley whats sitwell doing on a launch ship all right im gonna sweep the deck and find batroc nat you kill the engines and wait for instructions rumlow you sweep aft find the hostages get them to the lifepods get them out lets move strike you heard the cap gear up secure channel seven seven secure did you do anything fun saturday night well all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead so no not really coming up on the drop zone cap you know if you ask kristen out from statistics shed probably say yes thats why i dont ask too shy or too scared too busy was he wearing a parachute no no he wasnt hey dont move thanks yeah you seemed pretty helpless without me what about the nurse that lives across the hall from you she seems kind of nice secure the engine room then find me a date im multitasking i told batroc if we want to make shield pay us we have to start sending them bodies now i have a bullet for someone you want a bullet in your head move that foot you want a bullet in the head i dont like waiting call durand i want this ship ready to move when the ransom comes start the engines okay hey sailor shut up you want to be a hero is that it all right ive waited long enough hey find batroc if i dont hear anything in two minutes ill start killing them ill find him two minutes radio silence from shield batroc targets acquired strike in position natasha whats your status status natasha hang on engine room secure time is up who wants to die first you get that one on my mark three two one i told you shield doesnt negotiate the line just went dead ive lost contact with them hostages en route to extraction romanoff missed the rendezvous point cap hostiles are still in play natasha batrocs on the move circle back to rumlow and protect the hostages natasha i thought you were more than just a shield lets see well this is awkward what are you doing backing up the hard drive its a good habit to get into rumlow needed your help what the hell are you doing here youre saving shield intel whatever i can get my hands on our mission is to rescue hostages no thats your mission and youve done it beautifully you just jeopardized this whole operation i think thats overstating things okay that ones on me youre damn right you just cant stop yourself from lying can you i didnt lie agent romanoff had a different mission than yours which you didnt feel obliged to share im not obliged to do anything those hostages could have died nick i sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didnt happen soldiers trust each other thats what makes it an army not a bunch of guys running around shooting guns last time i trusted someone i lost an eye look i didnt want you doing anything you werent comfortable with agent romanoff is comfortable with everything i cant lead a mission when the people im leading have missions of their own its called compartmentalization nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all except you youre wrong about me i do share im nice like that  insight bay  captain rogers does not have clearance for project insight director override fury nicholas j confirmed you know they used to play music yeah my grandfather operated one of these things for  years granddad worked in a nice building got good tips hed walk home every night a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag hed say hi people would say hi back time went on the neighborhood got rougher hed say hi theyd say keep on steppin granddad got to gripping that lunch bag a little tighter did he ever get mugged every week some punk would say whats in the bag what would he do hed show them bunch of crumpled ones and a loaded  magnum yeah granddad loved people but he didnt trust them very much yeah i know theyre a little bit bigger than a  this is project insight three nextgeneration helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites launched from the lemurian star once we get them in the air they never need to come down continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines stark he had a few suggestions once he got an upclose look at our old turbines these new longrange precision guns can eliminate  hostiles a minute the satellites can read a terrorists dna before he steps outside his spider hole were gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen thought the punishment usually came after the crime we cant afford to wait that long whos we after new york i convinced the world security council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis for once were way ahead of the curve by holding a gun to everyone on earth and calling it protection you know i read those ssr files greatest generation you guys did some nasty stuff yeah we compromised sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well but we did it so that people could be free this isnt freedom this is fear shield takes the world as it is not as wed like it to be and its getting damn near past time for you to get with that program cap dont hold your breath welcome to the smithsonian visitor information booths are available on the second level a symbol to the nation a hero to the world the story of captain america is one of honor bravery and sacrifice denied enlistment due to poor health steven rogers was chosen for a program unique in the annals of american warfare one that would transform him into the worlds first supersoldier in this rare footage everyones favorite war hero captain america battle tested captain america and his howling commandos quickly earned their stripes their mission taking down hydra the nazi rogue science division best friends since childhood bucky barnes and steven rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield barnes is the only howling commando to give his life in service of his country that was a difficult winter a blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the german line steve captain rogers he fought his way through a hydra blockade that had pinned our allies down for months he saved over  men including the man who would who would become my husband as it turned out even after he died steve was still changing my life you should be proud of yourself peggy i have lived a life my only regret is that you didnt get to live yours what is it for as long as i can remember i just wanted to do what was right i guess im not quite sure what that is anymore and i thought i could throw myself back in and follow orders serve its just not the same youre always so dramatic look you saved the world we rather mucked it up you didnt knowing that you helped found shield is half the reason i stay hey the world has changed and none of us can go back all we can do is our best and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over peggy steve yeah youre alive you came back yeah peggy its been so long so long well i couldnt leave my best girl not when she owes me a dance secure office open lemurian stars satellite launch file access denied run decryption decryption failed director override fury nicholas j override denied all files sealed on whose authority fury nicholas j world security council confirmed if nick fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs and strike commandos to mop up his mess hes sadly mistaken this failure is unacceptable considering this attack took place one mile from my countrys sovereign waters its a bit more than that i move for immediate hearing we dont need hearings we need action its this councils duty to oversee shield a breach like this raises serious questions like how the hell did a french pirate manage to hijack a covert shield vessel in broad daylight for the record councilman hes algerian i can draw a map if itd help i appreciate your wit secretary pierce but this council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously really i dont i dont care about one boat i care about the fleet if this council is going to fall to rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field maybe we need someone to oversee us mr secretary nobody is suggesting excuse me more trouble mr secretary depends on your definition i work  floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit a nuclear war would do it too you busy in there nothing some earmarks cant fix im here to ask a favor i want you to call for a vote project insight has to be delayed nick thats not a favor thats a subcommittee hearing along one it could be nothing it probably is nothing i just need time to make sure its nothing but if its something then well both be damn glad those helicarriers arent in the air fine but you got to get iron man to stop by my nieces birthday party thank you sir and not just a flyby hes got to mingle the thing is i think its getting worse a cop pulled me over last week he thought i was drunk i swerved to miss a plastic bag i thought it was an ied some stuff you leave there other stuff you bring back its our job to figure out how to carry it is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little manpurse its up to you  ill see you next week  definitely look who it is the running man caught the last few minutes its pretty intense yeah

stand back three two one clear  pulse  no pulse okay  please stand back three two one clear get me epinephrine pulse negative dont do this to me nick dont do this to me whats the time  doctor time of death  am i need to take him natasha natasha why was fury in your apartment i dont know cap they want you back at shield yeah give me a second they want you now okay youre a terrible liar strike team escort captain rogers back to shield immediately for questioning i told him  lets go  yeah strike move it out captain rogers neighbor captain im alexander pierce sir its an honor the honors mine captain my father served in the st come on in that photo was taken five years after nick and i met when i was at state department in bogota eln rebels took the embassy and security got me out but the rebels took hostages nick was deputy chief of the shield station there and he comes to me with a plan he wants to storm the building through the sewers i said no well negotiate turned out the eln didnt negotiate so they put out a kill order they stormed the basement and what do they find they find it empty nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil and saved the lives of a dozen political officers including my daughter so you gave him a promotion ive never had any cause to regret it captain why was nick in your apartment last night i dont know did you know it was bugged i did because nick told me did he tell you he was the one who bugged it i want you to see something who hired you batroc is that live yeah they picked him up last night in a notsosafe house in algiers are you saying hes a suspect assassination isnt batrocs line no no its more complicated than that batroc was hired anonymously to attack the lemurian star and he was contacted by email and paid by wire transfer and then the money was run through  fictitious accounts the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a jacob veech am i supposed to know who that is not likely veech died six years ago his last address was  elmhurst drive when i first met nick his mother lived at  are you saying fury hired the pirates why the prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence the sale went sour and that led to nicks death if you really knew nick fury youd know thats not true why do you think were talking see i took a seat on the council not because i wanted to but because nick asked me to because we were both realists we knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down and that makes enemies those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better and the idea that those people could be happy today makes me really really angry captain you were the last one to see nick alive i dont think thats an accident and i dont think you do either so im gonna ask again why was he there he told me not to trust anyone i wonder if that included him im sorry those were his last words excuse me captain somebody murdered my friend and im gonna find out why anyone gets in my way theyre gonna regret it anyone understood operations control confirmed keep all strike personnel on site  understood  yes sir  forensics  confirmed cap rumlow evidence response found some fibers on the roof they want us to see you want me to get the tac team ready no lets wait and see what it is first right whats the status so far  administrations level  confirmed excuse me im sorry about what happened with fury its messed up what happened to him thank you records confirmed before we get started does anyone want to get out mobilize strike units th floor whoa big guy i just want you to know cap this isnt personal it kind of feels personal drop the shield and put your hands in the air give it up rogers get that door open you have nowhere to go are you kidding me hes headed for the garage lock down the bridge stand down captain rogers stand down repeat stand down eyes here whatever your op is bury it this is level one contact dot all traffic lights in the district go red shut all runways at bwi iad and reagan all security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here scan all open sources phones computers pdas whatever if someone tweets about this guy i want to know about it with all due respect if shield is conducting a manhunt for captain america we deserve to know why because he lied to us captain rogers has information regarding the death of director fury he refused to share it as difficult as this is to accept captain america is a fugitive from shield  where is it  safe  do better  where did you get it why would i tell you fury gave it to you why  whats on it  i dont know stop lying i only act like i know everything rogers i bet you knew fury hired the pirates didnt you well it makes sense the ship was dirty fury needed a way in so do you im not gonna ask you again i know who killed fury most of the intelligence community doesnt believe he exists the ones that do call him the winter soldier hes credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last  years so hes a ghost story five years ago i was escorting a nuclear engineer out of iran somebody shot out my tires near odessa we lost control went straight over a cliff i pulled us out but the winter soldier was there i was covering my engineer so he shot him straight through me soviet slug no rifling byebye bikinis yeah i bet you look terrible in them now going after him is a dead end i know ive tried like you said hes a ghost story well lets find out what the ghost wants nick fury was murdered in cold blood to any reasonable person that would make him a martyr not a traitor you know what makes him a traitor hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship nick fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying project insight a project he knew would expose his own illegal operations at best he lied to you at worst are you calling for my resignation ive got a pen and paper right here that discussion can be tabled for a later time but you do want to have a discussion weve already had it mr secretary this council moves to immediately reactivate project insight if you want to say something snappy now would be a good time first rule of going on the run is dont run walk if i run in these shoes theyre gonna fall off the drive has a level six homing program so as soon as we boot up shield will know exactly where we are how much time will we have about nine minutes from now fury was right about that ship somebodys trying to hide something this drive is protected by some sort of ai it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands can you override it the person who developed this is slightly smarter than me slightly im gonna try running a tracer this is a program that shield developed to track hostile malware so if we cant read the file maybe we can find out where it came from can i help you guys with anything no my fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations right were getting married congratulations where are you guys thinking about going new jersey i have the exact same glasses wow you two are practically twins yeah i wish specimen if you guys need anything ive been aaron thank you  you said nine minutes come on  relax got it you know it i used to lets go standard tac team two behind two across and two coming straight at us if they make us ill engage you hit the south escalator to the metro shut up and put your arm around me laugh at something i said  what  do it negative at the source give me a floor rundown negative on three negative on two snake the upper levels work down to me  kiss me  what public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable yes they do you still uncomfortable its not exactly the word i would use where did captain america learn how to steal a car nazi germany and were borrowing take your feet off the dash all right i have a question for you which you do not have to answer i feel like if you dont answer it though  youre kind of answering it you know  what was that your first kiss since   that bad huh  i didnt say that well it kind of sounds like thats what youre saying no i didnt i just wondered how much practice youve had  you dont need practice  everybody needs practice it was not my first kiss since  im  im not dead nobody special though believe it or not its kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience well thats all right you just make something up  what like you  i dont know the truth is a matter of circumstance its not all things to all people all the time neither am i thats a tough way to live its a good way not to die though you know its kind of hard to trust someone when you dont know who that someone really is yeah who do you want me to be how about a friend well theres a chance you might be in the wrong business rogers this is it the file came from these coordinates so did i this camp is where i was trained change much a little pick up the pace ladies lets go lets go double time come on rogers move it come on fall in rogers i said fall in this is a dead end zero heat signatures zero waves not even radio whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off what is it army regulations forbid storing munitions within  yards of the barracks this building is in the wrong place this is shield maybe where it started and theres starks father howard whos the girl if youre already working in a secret office why do you need to hide the elevator this cant be the data point this technology is ancient yes spells yes shall we play a game  its from a movie that was really  i know i saw it rogers steven born  romanoff natalia alianovna born  its some kind of recording i am not a recording fraulein i may not be the man i was when the captain took me prisoner in  but i am you know this thing arnim zola was a german scientist who worked for the red skull hes been dead for years first correction i am swiss second look around you i have never been more alive in  i received a terminal diagnosis science could not save my body my mind however that was worth saving on  feet of databanks you are standing in my brain  how did you get here  invited it was operation paperclip after world war ii shield recruited german scientists with strategic value they thought i could help their cause i also helped my own hydra died with the red skull cut off one head two more shall take its place prove it accessing archive hydra was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom what we did not realize was that if you try to take that freedom they resist the war taught us much humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly after the war shield was founded and i was recruited the new hydra grew a beautiful parasite inside shield for  years hydra has been secretly feeding crisis reaping war and when history did not cooperate history was changed thats impossible shield would have stopped you accidents will happen hydra created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security once a purification process is complete hydras new world order will arise we won captain your death amounts to the same as your life a zero sum as i was saying whats on this drive project insight requires insight so i wrote an algorithm what kind of algorithm what does it do the answer to your question is fascinating unfortunately you shall be too dead to hear it steve we got a bogey short range ballistic   seconds tops  who fired it shield i am afraid i have been stalling captain admit it its better this way we are both of us out of time call in the asset im going to go mr pierce you need anything before i leave no its fine renata you can go home okay nightnight good night want some milk the timetable has moved our window is limited two targets level six they already cost me zola i want confirmed death in  hours sorry mr pierce i i forgot my phone renata i wish you would have knocked hey man im sorry about this we need a place to lay low everyone we know is trying to kill us not everyone  you okay  yeah whats going on when i first joined shield i thought i was going straight but i guess i just traded in the kgb for hydra i thought i knew whose lies i was telling but i guess i cant tell the difference anymore theres a chance you might be in the wrong business i owe you its okay if it was the other way around and it was down to me to save your life now you be honest with me would you trust me to do it i would now and im always honest well you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing well guess i just like to know who im fighting i made breakfast if you guys eat that sort of thing so the question is who at shield could launch a domestic missile strike pierce who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world but hes not working alone zolas algorithm was on the lemurian star so was jasper sitwell so the real question is how do the two most wanted people in washington kidnap a shield officer in broad daylight the answer is you dont  whats this  call it a résumé is this bakhmala the khalid khandil mission that was you you didnt say he was a pararescue  is this riley  yeah i heard they couldnt bring in the choppers because of the rpgs what did you use a stealth chute no these i thought you said you were a pilot i never said pilot i cant ask you to do this sam you got out for a good reason dude captain america needs my help theres no better reason to get back in where can we get our hands on one of these things the last one is at fort meade behind three guarded gates and a inch steel wall shouldnt be a problem listen i got to fly home tonight because i got some constituency problem and i got to press the flesh any constituent in particular mr senator no not really twentythree kind of hot real hot you know wants to be a reporter i think i dont know who listens at that point doesnt sound like much of a problem to me really because shes killing my back but this isnt the place to talk about it this is a nice pin  thank you  come here hail hydra  see its right there  yeah i just saw that  should i get it checked  i think you should i need a minute bring the car around yes sir agent sitwell how was lunch i hear the crab cakes here are delicious who is this the goodlooking guy in the sunglasses your  oclock your other  oclock there you go what do you want youre gonna go around the corner to your right theres a gray car two spaces down you and i are gonna take a ride and why would i do that because that tie looks really expensive and id hate to mess it up tell me about zolas algorithm never heard of it what were you doing on the lemurian star i was throwing up i get seasick is this little display meant to insinuate that youre gonna throw me off the roof because its really not your style rogers youre right its not its hers wait what about that girl from accounting laura lillian lip piercing right yeah shes cute yeah im not ready for that zolas algorithm is a program for choosing  insights targets  what targets you a tv anchor in cairo the under secretary of defense a high school valedictorian in iowa city bruce banner stephen strange anyone whos a threat to hydra now or in the future in the future how could it know how could it not the st century is a digital book zola taught hydra how to read it your bank records medical histories voting patterns emails phone calls your damn sat scores zolas algorithm evaluates peoples past to predict their future and what then oh my god pierce is gonna kill me what then then the insight helicarriers scratch people off the list a few million at a time hydra doesnt like leaks then why dont you try sticking a cork in it insights launching in  hours were cutting it a little bit close here i know well use him to bypass the dna scans and access the helicarriers directly what are you crazy that is a terrible terrible idea shit hang on i have her find him go i got this taking fire above and below expressway civilians threatened repeat civilians threatened i make an lz  block of virginia avenue rendezvous two minutes get out of the way stay out of the way bucky who the hell is bucky drop the shield cap get on your knees get on your knees get down get down get on your knees down dont move put the gun down not here not here it was him he looked right at me like he didnt even know me how is that even possible it was like  years ago zola buckys whole unit was captured in  zola experimented on him whatever he did helped bucky survive the fall they must have found him and none of thats your fault steve even when i had nothing i had bucky we need to get a doctor here if we dont put pressure on that wound shes gonna bleed out here in the truck that thing was squeezing my brain who is this guy three holes start digging gsw shes lost at least a pint maybe two  let me take her  shell want to see him first about damn time lacerated spinal column cracked sternum shattered collarbone perforated liver and one hell of a headache dont forget your collapsed lung lets not forget that otherwise im good they cut you open your heart stopped tetrodotoxin b slows the pulse to one beat a minute banner developed it for stress didnt work so great for him but we found a use for it why all the secrecy why not just tell us any attempt on the directors life had to look successful cant kill you if youre already dead besides i wasnt sure who to trust sergeant barnes bucky no the procedure has already started you are to be the new fist of hydra put him on ice sir hes unstable erratic mission report mission report now the man on the bridge who was he you met him earlier this week on another assignment i knew him your work has been a gift to mankind you shaped the century and i need you to do it one more time societys at a tipping point between order and chaos and tomorrow morning were gonna give it a push but if you dont do your part i cant do mine and hydra cant give the world the freedom it deserves but i knew him prep him hes been out of cryo freeze too long then wipe him and start over this man declined the nobel peace prize he said peace wasnt an achievement it was a responsibility see its stuff like this that gives me trust issues we have to stop the launch i dont think the councils accepting my calls anymore whats that once the helicarriers reach  feet theyll triangulate with insight satellites becoming fully weaponized we need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own one or two wont cut it we need to link all three carriers for this to work because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die we have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is hydra we have to get past them insert these server blades and maybe just maybe we can salvage whats left were not salvaging anything were not just taking down the carriers nick were taking down shield shield had nothing to do with this you gave me this mission this is how it ends shields been compromised you said so yourself hydra grew right under your nose and nobody noticed why do you think were meeting in this cave i noticed how many paid the price before you did look i didnt know about barnes even if you had would you have told me or would you have compartmentalized that too shield hydra it all goes hes right dont look at me i do what he does just slower well it looks like youre giving the orders now captain we looked for you after my folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery i know im sorry i just kind of wanted to be alone how was it it was okay shes next to dad i was gonna ask i know what youre gonna say buck i just we can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids itll be fun all you got to do is shine my shoes maybe take out the trash come on thank you buck but i can get by on my own the thing is you dont have to im with you to the end of the line pal hes gonna be there you know i know look whoever he used to be and the guy he is now i dont think hes the kind you save hes the kind you stop i dont know if i can do that well he might not give you a choice he doesnt know you he will gear up its time you gonna wear that no if youre gonna fight a war you got to wear a uniform oh man i am so fired we are in final launch sequence we are go on guidance all personnel to launch stations and how was your flight lovely the ride from the airport less so sadly shield cant control everything including captain america this facility is biometrically controlled and these will give you unrestricted access ive been parking there for two months  but its his spot  so wheres he been i think afghanistan negative dt six the pattern is full well he couldve said something must be the dish ill check it out triskelion command request we clear the area for launch excuse us i know the road hasnt exactly been smooth and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way finally were here and the world should be grateful attention all shield agents this is steve rogers youve heard a lot about me over the last few days some of you were even ordered to hunt me down but i think its time you know the truth shield is not what we thought it was its been taken over by hydra alexander pierce is their leader the strike and insight crew are hydra as well i dont know how many more but i know theyre in the building they could be standing right next to you they almost have what they want absolute control they shot nick fury and it wont end there if you launch those helicarriers today hydra will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way unless we stop them i know im asking a lot but the price of freedom is high it always has been and its a price im willing to pay and if im the only one then so be it but im willing to bet im not did you write that down first or was it off the top of your head you smug son of a bitch arrest him i guess ive got the floor preempt the launch sequence send those ships up now is there a problem is there a problem im sorry sir im not gonna launch those ships captains orders move away from your station like he said hold it right there put the gun down captains orders you picked the wrong side agent depends on where youre standing close the bay door close the bay door now close the bay door theyre initiating launch hey cap how do we know the good guys from the bad guys if theyre shooting at you theyre bad hey cap i found those bad guys you were talking about you okay im not dead yet let me ask you a question what if pakistan marched into mumbai tomorrow and you knew that they were going to drag your daughters

james buchanan barnes shut up im not gonna fight you youre my friend youre my mission youre my mission then finish it because im with you to the end of the line on your left do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i do why havent we yet heard from captain rogers i dont know what there is left for him to say i think the wreck in the middle of the potomac made his point fairly eloquently well he could explain how this country is expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus hydra was selling you lies not intelligence many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling agent you should know that there are some on this committee who feel given your service record both for this country and against it that you belong in a penitentiary not mouthing off on capitol hill youre not going to put me in a prison youre not going to put any of us in a prison you know why do enlighten us because you need us yes the world is a vulnerable place and yes we help make it that way but were also the ones best qualified to defend it so if you want to arrest me arrest me youll know where to find me so youve experienced this sort of thing before you get used to it weve been data mining hydras files looks like a lot of rats didnt go down with the ship im headed to europe tonight wanted to ask if youd come theres something i got to do first how about you wilson could use a man with your abilities im more of a soldier than a spy all right then anybody asks for me tell them they can find me right here you should be honored thats about as close as he gets to saying thank you not going with him no  not staying here  nah i blew all my covers i got to go figure out a new one that might take a while im counting on it that thing you asked for i called in a few favors from kiev will you do me a favor call that nurse shes not a nurse and youre not a shield agent  what was her name again  sharon shes nice be careful steve you might not want to pull on that thread youre going after him you dont have to come with me i know when do we start its over fury has released everything to the public everything he knows about herr strucker if they get word of our work here if they find out we serve hydra hydra shield two sides of a coin thats no longer currency what we have is worth more than any of them ever knew weve only scratched the surface and already there are other facilities doing hydras good work around the world well feed them to captain america and his colorful friends and keep them off our scent what about the volunteers the dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts wont be able to find them and the survivors the twins sooner or later they will meet the twins its not a world of spies anymore not even a world of heroes this is the age of miracles doctor theres nothing more horrifying than a miracledo you know what time it is cant sleep there are tabs for that yeah but then id be sleeping dreams again wanna fight i slipped right you slipped as a result of me punching you in the face i was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face the two events were not related tell me about this dream  anything new  no you have to let go of the past i dont remember my past its causing you doubt and doubt makes you vulnerable control it lose control again and youll have to commune with the supreme intelligence theres nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion humor is a distraction and anger anger only serves the enemy one hundred twenty days since the last skrull attack has anyone ever seen what the supreme intelligence really looks like no one can look upon the supreme intelligence in its true form you know that our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us so its sacred its personal no kree divulges it ever who do you see  your brother  no  father  no  your old commander  vers its me you see isnt it i see what youre trying to do  is it working  yes but you wont succeed in changing the subject what is the point of giving me these if you dont want me to use them i want you to use them the supreme intelligence gave me a responsibility of showing you how to use them i know how yeah if that were true youd be able to knock me down without them control your impulses stop using this start using this i want you to be the best version of yourself vers intelligence your commander insists that youre fit to serve i am you struggle with your emotions with your past which fuels them you are just one victim of the skrull expansion that has threatened our civilization for centuries imposters who silently infiltrate then take over our planets horrors that you remember and so much that you do not its all blank my life youre supposed to take the form of who i most admire but i dont even remember who this person was to me perhaps this is a mercy sparing you from a deeper pain freeing you to do what all kree must put your peoples needs before your own weve given you a great gift the chance to fight for the good of all kree i want to serve then master yourself what was given can be taken away i wont let you down well know soon enough you have a mission serve well and with honor this cant be good must be another skrull attack whatever it is its big has a skrull ever simmed you once  it was deeply disturbing  why because i stared into the face of my mortal enemy and the face staring back was my own maybe if you were more attractive then it would be less disturbing you think youre funny but im not laughing you never laugh i laugh on the inside im not doing that now its funny cause objectively speaking youre quite handsome well thank you listen up team knock it off all right prepare for a search and rescue of our spy sohlarr the skrulls have invaded yet another border planet this time torfa sohlarr sent us a warning the signal was intercepted and his covers blown the skrull general talos has sent kill units to find him should they reach him before we do the intelligence hes acquired over three years is as good as theirs the accusers will bomb a skrull stronghold here in the south we slip in we locate sohlarr and we get out leaving them none the wiser the torfan populace we are not to interfere with them nor them with us nothing compromises the security of our mission proceed with caution follow protocol before extracting him this is a dangerous mission we must all be ready to join the collective if that is our fate today for the good of all kree for the good of

started i wouldnt get too close there boss no one in or out boom what can i get ya where was this photograph taken an airport wheres pegasus thats classified not unlike the file i started on you but i see youve changed it up a bit since then grunge is a good look for you did you have a rough day agent fury it was cool you know had a space invasion big car chase got to watch an alien autopsy typical ninetofive so you saw one i was never one to believe in aliens but i cant unsee that this is gonna get a little awkward but i gotta ask you think im one of those green things cant be too careful you are looking at  redblooded earth man im afraid im gonna need proof we talking cheek swab or urine sample no the dna would match want my aol password skrulls can only sim recent memories  of their host bodies  oh oh you wanna get personal  where were you born  huntsville alabama but technically i dont remember that part  name of your first pet  mr snoofers  mr snoofers  thats what i said do i pass not yet first job soldier straight out of high school left the ranks a full bird colonel  then  spy  where  it was the cold war we were everywhere uh belfast bucharest belgrade budapest i like the bs i can make them rhyme  now  been riding a desk for the past six years trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from never occurred to me they would be coming from above name a detail so bizarre a skrull could never fabricate it if toast is cut diagonally i cant eat it you didnt need that did you no no i didnt but i enjoyed it okay your turn prove youre not a skrull and how is that supposed to prove to me youre not a skrull thats a photon blast and a skrull cant do that so a full bird colonel turned spy turned shield agent must have pretty high security clearance wheres pegasus okay the skrulls sim alien races to infiltrate and take over planets and youre a kree a race of noble warriors heroes noble warrior heroes so um what do skrulls want with dr lawson they believe that she developed a lightspeed engine at pegasus lightspeed engine gotta admit thats not the craziest thing ive heard today well its still early and you what do you want to stop the skrulls before they become unstoppable and look war is a universal language i know a rogue soldier when i see one you got a personal stake in this this is government property turn your vehicle around nicholas joseph fury agent of shield place your thumb on the pad one moment nicholas joseph fury you have three names everybody calls me fury not nicholas not joseph not nick just fury  what does your mom call you  fury  what do you call her  fury what about your kids if i have them theyll call me fury you are cleared for access thank you oh hold up you look like somebodys disaffected niece put that on  what is it

you just look at you arent you the cutest little thing arent you cute and whats your name huh whats your name goose cool name for a cool cat fury hmm ill be back oh let me get my fingerprint out just let me unravel this puppy you sat there and watched me play with tape when all you had to do was i didnt wanna steal your thunder huh lawson lawsons plan for the lightspeed engine i wonder why they terminated the project um maybe because shes cuckoo kree glyphs hmm lawson is not cuckoo shes kree well shes dead what she crashed the asis aircraft doing an unauthorized test flight took a pilot down with her thats why security here is so unfriendly theyre covering up a billiondollar mistake oh and your lightspeed engine is toast when did this crash happen six years ago  who was the pilot um most of this things redacted but there is a testimonial here from a maria rambeau last person to see them alive you okay mmhmm back in a minute this isnt about fighting wars its about ending them i know lawson was kree she was here on c and died in a plane crash do you know anything about this i just discovered a mission report sent from c theres only so much im cleared to tell you vers but lawson was an undercover kree operative named marvell she was working on a unique energy core experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war she still here shes cooperating with the investigation sir  you men stay here  yes sir i want to question her alone excellent work nicholas does it say anything about me anything about you no of course not why would it i found evidence that i had a life here on c marvell is who i see when i visit the supreme intelligence i knew her and i knew her as lawson this sounds like skrull simulation vers no its not because i remember i was here stop remember your training know your enemy it could be you do not let your emotions override your judgment shes on sublevel six ill get off on five and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it do a pincer move like we did in havana right like we did in havana were nearing the jump point leave your beacon on so i can find you well get to the bottom of this vers together okay vers vers furys colluding with the target then why would he call us in all i know is we take him in too dead or alive dead or alive go go go was it something i said mmmmmm now you know i dont really need these to see but they do kinda complete the look dont you think you called them in my bad coulson do you have eyes on them theyre not down here lets try up there  what  your communicator you obviously cant be trusted with it do you know how to fly this thing uh well see thats a yes or no question yes thats what im talking about we got a stowaway hang on goose goose no goose whos a good kitty huh huh goose yes thats right whos a good kitty goose you the good kitty thats right see anyone you know funny story i arrived on hala near dead no memory that was six years ago so you think youre the pilot that went down with dr lawson im saying the last person to see them alive could probably tell us  maria rambeau  mmhmm so how do we get to louisiana due east hang a right at memphis that agent that stopped the skrulls from finding us coulson the new guy i guess he doesnt hate me yet yeah well give him time i guess he had a feeling you know went with his gut against orders thats a really hard thing to do but its what keeps us human i get in trouble for that a lot oh i can see that about you rescuing the guy who sold you out to the skrulls im guessing thats not standard kree operating procedure well i wont tell your boss if you dont tell mine ronan the accusers completed their operation but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team it was a trap to lure our operative vers to torfa and kidnap her give us their location well take care of the terrorist threat by bombing them out of the galaxy no well handle this a cell of skrulls anywhere is a threat to kree everywhere where are they  they are  lost they are lost for now but we will find them do so or we will maintain the course for c excuse me im looking for maria rambeau auntie carol mom its auntie carol i knew it everyone said you were dead but we knew they were lying im not really who you think i am that is the craziest shit i ever heard green transforming aliens theres no such thing you are absolutely right young lady there is no such thing cause if there were we would want to keep that to ourselves you dont believe me no way thats so cool oh she can do a lot more than make tea with those hands like what show us maybe later i kept all your stuff ill go get it you want to give her a hand with that hmm you dont remember anything i see flashes little moments but i cant tell whats real if i could just piece together what happened that morning maybe itll all make sense you woke me up banging on my door at dawn your usual move back then we had to get up so early the air force still wasnt letting women fly combat so testing lawsons planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered you wanted to race to base in your old mustang and i wasnt about to argue cause i knew my camaro would dominate but you cheated took a shortcut since when is a shortcut cheating since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement i definitely dont remember those hmm of course you dont when i got to the hangar lawson was agitated she said she had lives to save she was trying to take the asis up herself but you said that if there were lives at stake i would fly the plane yeah yep big hero moment the kind of moment wed both been waiting for the doc was always unique thats why we liked her but now youre saying shes from another planet i know this must be hard for you oh what this part right here no no mmmmmm oh whats hard is losing my best friend in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened hard is knowing you were out there somewhere too damn stubborn to die and now you come up in here after six years with your supercharged fire hands and you expect me to call you i dont even know what vers is that really who you are now i dont know come look this is me and you on halloween im amelia earhart and youre janis joplin oh this is you when you were little you didnt get along with your parents so mom said we became your real family this is us on christmas i got my favorite bunny slippers this is another picture of you when you were little youve always wanted to be a pilot and this is right after you graduated this was your dog that you got for christmas this is a picture of everybody from your air force team and this is you with mom right after a good day of training these were your three favorite guys oh wait i forgot your jacket mom doesnt let me wear it anymore after i spilled ketchup on it that was all that survived the crash or so we thought dont answer that its just my neighbor they can change into anyone hi there what do you want  uh  hey tom this is my friend carol oh pleased to meet you yowzers static electricity out heres no joke i noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road and i was just wondering if you mind if i bring the boys over to get a closer looksee  a closer looksee  yeah to see the bird parked out by the road mmm youre really working overtime to sell this one arent you talos im sorry tom this really isnt a good time ill come by tomorrow okay  uh  okay you know you really should be kinder to your neighbors you never know when youre gonna need to borrow some sugar now hang on a second before you go swinging those jazz hands around making a mess of your friends house its a lovely home miss oh my god what the hell no ones gonna hurt the girl just dont kill me that would really complicate the situation im about five seconds from complicating that wall with some uglyass skrull brains im sorry i simmed your boss but now i stand before you as my true self without deception and who is that out there okay thats a fair point but im sure that you understand i had to take some precautions i saw you crush  of my best men with your hands bound i just wanna talk last time we talked i ended up hanging from my ankles that was before i knew who you were before i knew what made you different from the others i have an audio recording from pegasus of your voice from a plane crash six years ago on a device i believe you call a black box they told me it was destroyed in the crash howd you get it she dont understand young lady i have a special skill that kind of allows me to get into places im not supposed to be call me young lady again im gonna put my foot in a place its not supposed to be am i supposed to guess where that is your ass okay i get it were all a little on edge here but look i just need your help decoding some coordinates if youll sit down and youll listen to this i assure you itll be worth your while call your buddy back inside and ill listen deal oh my god get that thing away howd that get in here hmm the cat this isnt what youre afraid of is it thats not a cat  thats a flerken  a flerken mom monica  why cant i listen too  shh whats happening its loading punch in the coordinates  negative    copy that where are we going doc my laboratory your laboratory what do you mean oh no is that wait what is that its not showing up on my radar go carol fly thats no mig lawson who the hell are they those are the bad guys fly faster now yes maam  what do they want  me my work i never should have brought you along here come some gs theyre firing backwards hold on bail out bail out bail out stay with me lawson carol come in do you copy yeah i copy we hit ground carol are you okay do you copy yeah i copy doc your blood its blue yeah but uh hows my hair help me out will ya i gotta destroy it before they get here lawson you remember what i said about our work here what its for to end wars yeah but the wars are bigger than you know damn it my name is not lawson my real name is marvell and i come from a planet called hala i would say that youre delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue listen i spent half my life fighting a shameful war now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets just remember the coordinates okay you gotta save em without me save who how now i gotta blow this engine before they find it what are you doing we have no interest in hurting you no cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression the energy core where is it pararescues on the way you have two minutes until youre surrounded then i see no reason to prolong this conversation no wait you mean that energy core no commander shes still moving permission to fire hold your fire theres nothing left the core has been destroyed she absorbed its power shes coming with us he lied to me everything that i knew was a lie now you understand what what do i understand now yonrogg killed marvell he killed her cause she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war no your people are terrorists they kill innocents i saw the ruins on torfa ruins that the accusers are responsible for my people lived as refugees on torfa homeless ever since we resisted kree rule and they destroyed our planet and the handful of us that are left will be slaughtered next unless you help me finish what marvell started the core that she found would have powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety a new home where the kree cant reach us lawson always told us that our work at pegasus wasnt to fight wars but to end them she wanted you to help us find the core well i already destroyed it no you destroyed the engine the core that powered it is in a remote location if you help us decode those coordinates we can find it youll use it to destroy us we just want a home you and i lost everything at the hands of the kree cant you see it now youre not one of them you dont know me you have no idea who i am i dont even know who i am you are carol danvers you are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing my best friend who supported me as a mother and a pilot when no one else did you are smart and funny and a huge pain in the ass and you were the most powerful person i knew way before you could shoot fire from your fists you hear me do you hear me come here come here girl i got you i know i dont deserve your trust but you were our only lead we discovered that your energy signature matched marvells core now we know why if only you knew the importance of it to me i just need your help decoding the coordinates to marvells lab those werent coordinates theyre state vectors for orbital position and velocity you didnt find her lab on earth cause its not on earth that was the location on the date of the crash six years ago if we track its course well find it in orbit right now its just basic physics in orbit was that so difficult to figure out i mean youre my science guy right yonrogg will catch up to me soon weve got to get to the core before he does mmm were going to space in what a few tweaks to your vessel should do it i can handle the modifications mmm your science guy well i could use a copilot no no i cant i cant leave monica mom its okay i can stay with gramma and pawpaw theres no way im going baby its too dangerous testing brandnew aerospace tech is dangerous and you used to do that your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologicallysuperior foreign enemy correct thats what im saying  you have to go  monica you have a chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions and youre gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch fresh prince with me what i just think you should consider what kind of example youre setting for your daughter whats going on around here i know i know ill explain inside thank you your moms lucky when they were handing out kids they gave her the toughest one lieutenant trouble you remembered is that mine no no you hang on to it until i come back but there is something that i need your help with i cant wear these kree colors anymore and since you are obviously the only person around here with any sense of style hmm whoa no uhuh definitely not well since were on the same team hmm how do i look fresh what took you so long im fine thanks for asking  pryb  no no codes that system is fallible as weve learned okay then lets do this who do i see when i commune with the supreme intelligence the person you most admire and respect id guess but you would never tell me who and what is your earliest memory of hala the transfusion blue blood running through my veins whose blood hmm thats my blood thats coursing through her veins what have you done with her youre too late she knows ronan skrulls have infiltrated c come at once for the good of all kree commander the infestation will be eradicated passing  and climbing you know you really shouldnt have that thing on your lap our little alliance with you is tenuous at best and as long as he continues to freak you out like that yeah im gonna keep giving him all the loves and hugs that he needs right can i ask you something do you just turn into anything you want ah well i have to see it first can you all do it physiologically yeah but uh it takes practice and um dare i say it talent to do it well  can you turn into a cat  whats a cat what about a filing cabinet why would i turn into a filing cabinet a venus flytrap ill give you  bucks right now if you turn into a venus flytrap switching engines from scramjet to fusion buckle up folks hey is this normal like space turbulence pretty much locking in on coordinate grid where is it its here its gotta be here well is it in front of all that nothing or behind it decloaking activated is that it the core in her notes she called it the tesseract whoa what was lawson doing with all this kid stuff were not alone talos he didnt come here for the tesseract its okay we didnt know what to do marvell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the kree would find us you did the right thing its okay its okay shes all right shes a friend i am not gonna hurt you she led me to you im so sorry i didnt know carol this is war my hands are filthy from it too but were here now you found my family this is just the beginning there are thousands of us separated from each other scattered throughout the galaxy if i played the same pinball machine for six years id have some high scores too fraternizing with the enemy uhuh what did you do to your uniform they got in her head just like we thought the supreme intelligence will set her straight you can see theyre not soldiers let em go you can have me and the core you lied to me i made you the best version of yourself whats given can be taken away back here move move get over here get down lets go go move there she is seems like your time on c jogged the old memory this jacket its killer by the way oh the music its a nice touch let me out no can do if you hurt them i will burn you to the ground with what exactly your power comes from us you didnt give me these powers the blast did and yet youve never had the strength to control them on your own species flerken threat high its a cat not hannibal lecter species human male threat low to none that things clearly busted load the flerken onto the helion eject the others into space you did good ace thanks to you those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more i used to believe your lies but the skrulls are just fighting for a home youre talking about destroying them because they wont submit to your rule and neither will i we found you we embraced you as our own you stole me from my home my family my friends its cute how hard you try but remember without us give it up carol stay down youre weak youre going too fast you need to go slow youre flawed are you trying to kill yourself helpless youre too

a bogey coming in hot yes boom whoo what the hell was that deploy ballistic warheads thats impossible c doesnt have a defense system advanced enough to destroy our warheads thats not their defense system ronan take her down whoo return to the jump point well be back for the weapon the core the woman im so proud of you youve come a long way since i found you that day by the lake but can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on or will they get the better of you as always i always told you youll be ready the day you can knock me down as yourself this is that moment this is that moment vers turn off the light show and prove to me you can beat me without i have nothing to prove to you destination hala i cant go back emptyhanded you wont be emptyhanded im sending you with

congratulations soldier are you ready dr zola my machine requires the most delicate calibration forgive me if i seem overcautious are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for transference with this artifact i am certain of nothing i fear it may not work at all twenty percent forty sixty stabilizing at  i have not come all this way for safety doctor what was that i must congratulate you arnim your designs do not disappoint though they may require some slight reinforcement the exchange is stable amazing the energy we have just collected could power my designs all my designs this will change the war dr zola this will change the world ready exercise recruits attention gentlemen i am agent carter i supervise all operations for this division whats with the accent queen victoria i thought i was signing up for the us army whats your name soldier gilmore hodge your majesty step forward hodge put your right foot forward we gonna wrassle cause i got a few moves i know youll like agent carter colonel phillips i can see that you are breaking in the candidates thats good get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention till somebody comes tells you what to do yes sir general patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men we are going to win this war because we have the best men and because they are going to get better much better the strategic scientific reserve is an allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world our goal is to create the best army in history but every army starts with one man rogers get off of there at the end of this week we will choose that man he will be the first in a new breed of supersoldier rogers get that rifle out of the mud and they will personally escort adolf hitler to the gates of hell pick up the pace ladies lets go lets go double time come on faster faster move move squad halt that flag means were only at the halfway point first man to bring it to me gets a ride back with agent carter move move come on get up there if thats all you got this armys in trouble get up there hodge come on get up there nobodys got that flag in  years now fall back into line come on fall in lets go get back into formation rogers i said fall in thank you sir faster ladies come on my grandmother has more life in her god rest her soul move it youre not really thinking about picking rogers are you im more than just thinking about it he is the clear choice when you brought a pound asthmatic onto my army base i let it slide i thought what the hell maybe hed be useful to you like a gerbil i never thought youd pick him up you stick a needle in that kids arm its gonna go right through him  come on girls  look at that hes making me cry i am looking for qualities beyond the physical do you know how long it took to set up this project all the groveling i had to do in front of senator whatshisnames committees brandt yes i know i am well aware of your efforts then throw me a bone hodge passed every test we gave him hes big hes fast he obeys orders  hes a soldier  he is a bully you dont win wars with niceness doctor you win wars with guts grenade get away get back it was a dummy grenade all clear back in formation is this a test hes still skinny  may i  yeah cant sleep i got the jitters i guess me too can i ask you a question just one why me i suppose that is the only question that matters this is from augsburg my city so many people forget that the first country the nazis invaded was their own you know after the last war my people struggled they felt weak they felt small and then hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and he hears of me my work and he finds me and he says you he says you will make us strong well i am not interested so he sends the head of hydra his research division a brilliant scientist by the name of johann schmidt now schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he is ambitious he and hitler share a passion for occult power and teutonic myth hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers but for schmidt it is not fantasy for him it is real he has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth left here by the gods waiting to be seized by a superior man so when he hears about my formula and what it can do he cannot resist schmidt must become that superior man did it make him stronger yes but there were other effects the serum was not ready but more important the man the serum amplifies everything that is inside so good becomes great bad becomes worse this is why you were chosen because a strong man who has known power all his life may lose respect for that power but a weak man knows the value of strength and knows compassion thanks i think whatever happens tomorrow you must promise me one thing that you will stay who you are not a perfect soldier but a good man to the little guys no no wait wait what i am doing no you have procedure tomorrow no fluids all right well drink it after no i dont have procedure tomorrow drink it after i drink it now is there something in particular you need i understand you found him see for yourself you disapprove i just dont see why you need concern yourself i cant imagine he will succeed again his serum is the allies only defense against this power we now possess if we take it away from them then our victory is assured shall i give the order it has been given good dr zola what do you think a masterpiece i know this neighborhood i got beat up in that alley and that parking lot and behind that diner did you have something against running away you start running theyll never let you stop you stand up you push back they cant say no forever right i know a little of what thats like to have every door shut in your face i guess i just dont know why youd want to join the army if you were a beautiful dame or a a woman an agent not a dame you are beautiful but you have no idea how to talk to a woman do you i think this is the longest conversation ive had with one women arent exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on you must have danced well asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying and the past few years it just didnt seem to matter that much i figured id wait for what the right partner this way  what are we doing here  follow me wonderful weather this morning isnt it yes but i always carry an umbrella good morning please not now are you ready good take off your shirt your tie and your hat senator brandt glad you could make it why exactly am i in brooklyn we needed access to the citys power grid of course if youd given me the generators i requisitioned a lot of people are asking for funds colonel this is fred clemson state department if this project of yours comes through wed like to see it used for something other than headlines jesus somebody get that kid a sandwich comfortable its a little big you save me any of that schnapps not as much as i should have sorry next time mr stark how are your levels  levels at   good we may dim half the lights in brooklyn but we are ready as well ever be agent carter dont you think you would be more comfortable in the booth  yes of course sorry  good do you hear me is this on ladies and gentlemen today we take not another step towards annihilation but the first step on the path to peace we begin with a series of microinjections into the subjects major muscle groups the serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change and then to stimulate growth the subject will be saturated with vitarays that wasnt so bad that was penicillin serum infusion beginning in five four three two one now mr stark steven can you hear me its probably too late to go to the bathroom right we will proceed thats  twenty percent thirty thats  vital signs are normal thats  sixty seventy steven  steven  shut it down shut it down kill the reactor mr stark turn it off kill it kill the reactor no dont i can do this eighty ninety thats  mr stark steven steven the son of a bitch did it  i did it  yeah yeah i think we did it you actually did it how do you feel taller you look taller how do you like brooklyn now senator i can think of some folks in berlin who are about to get very nervous congratulations doctor thank you sir stop him what are you doing buddy are you all right hey this guys been shot i had him sorry im sorry no no not my son  stop it  dont hurt him get back let me go let go of my son dont hurt him wait dont dont no dont go get him i can swim  who the hell are you  the first of many cut off one head two more shall take its place hail hydra the führer is not accustomed to being ignored herr schmidt he funds your research because you promised him weapons you serve at his pleasure he gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries reward call it what it is exile i no longer reflect his image of aryan perfection you think this is about appearances your hydra division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year and we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a fullscale incursion into norway the führer feels how does he put it the red skull has been indulged long enough gentlemen you have come to see the results of our work let me show you hitler speaks of a year reich but he cannot feed his armies for a month his troops

no idea havent i no matter what lies erskine told you you see i was his greatest success you dont have one of those do you you are deluded captain you pretend to be a simple soldier but in reality you

no sign of activity  go get a cup of coffee corporal  yes sir i cant touch stark hes rich and hes the armys number one weapons contractor you are neither one with respect sir i dont regret my actions and i dont think captain rogers did either what makes you think i give a damn about your opinions i took a chance with you agent carter and now americas golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead cause you had a crush it wasnt that i had faith well i hope thats a big comfort to you when they shut this division down what the hells going on out there look who it is some of these men need medical attention  medic we got wounded  right over here id like to surrender myself for disciplinary action that wont be necessary yes sir faith huh youre late couldnt call my ride hey lets hear it for captain america i am honored to present this medal for valor to my personal friend captain america captain america captain thats your cue i thought hed be taller the fifth one was here in poland right near the baltic and the sixth one was about here   miles west of the maginot line i just got a quick look well nobodys perfect these are the weapon factories we know about sergeant barnes said that hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isnt on this map agent carter coordinate with ml i want every allied eyeball looking for that main hydra base what about us we are going to set a fire under johann schmidts ass what do you say rogers its your map  you think you can wipe hydra off it  yes sir ill need a team were already putting together the best men with all due respect sir so am i so lets get this straight we barely got out of there alive and you want us to go back pretty much sounds rather fun actually im in were in hell ill always fight but you got to do one thing for me whats that open a tab well that was easy  another round  where are they putting all this stuff see i told you theyre all idiots how about you you ready to follow captain america into the jaws of death hell no that little guy from brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight im following him but youre keeping the outfit right you know what its kind of growing on me  captain  agent carter maam howard has some equipment for you to try tomorrow morning sounds good i see your top squad is prepping for duty you dont like music i do actually i might even when this is all over go dancing then what are we waiting for the right partner  captain yes maam ill be there im invisible im turning into you its like a horrible dream dont take it so hard maybe shes got a friend emission signature is unusual alpha and beta ray neutral though i doubt rogers picked up on that seems harmless enough hard to see what all the fuss is about write that down excuse me im looking for mr stark hes in with colonel phillips of course youre welcome to wait i read about what you did oh the yeah well thats you know just doing what needed to be done sounded like more than that you saved nearly  men really its not a big deal tell that to their wives i dont think they were all married youre a hero well that depends on the definition really the women of america they owe you their thanks and seeing as theyre not here captain were ready for you if youre not otherwise occupied agent carter wait looks like finding a partner wasnt that hard after all peggy thats not what you thought it was i dont think anything captain not one thing you always wanted to be a soldier and now you are just like all the rest well what about you and stark how do i know you two havent been fondueing you still dont know a bloody thing about women fondue is just cheese and bread my friend  really i didnt think  nor should you pal the moment you think you know whats going on in a womans head is the moment your goose is well and truly cooked me i concentrate on work which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed carbon polymer should withstand your average german bayonet although hydras not going to attack you with a pocket knife i hear youre kind of attached its handier than you might think i took the liberty of coming up with some options this ones fun shes been fitted with electrical relays that allow you to  what about this one  no no thats just a prototype  whats it made of  vibranium its stronger than steel and a third the weight its completely vibration absorbent how come its not standard issue thats the rarest metal on earth what youre holding there thats all weve got you quite finished mr stark im sure the captain has some unfinished business what do you think yes i think it works i had some ideas about the uniform whatever you want pal you are failing we are close to an offensive that will shake the planet yet we are continually delayed because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield this is hardly my area of expertise i merely developed the weapons i cannot fire them finish your mission doctor before the american finishes his sir im sorry herr schmidt we fought to the last man evidently not remember when i made you ride the cyclone at coney island yeah and i threw up this isnt payback is it now why would i do that we were right dr zolas on the train hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle wherever hes going they must need him bad lets get going because theyre moving like the devil we only got about a second window you miss that window were bugs on a windshield mind the gap better get moving bugs stop him fire again  i had him on the ropes  i know you did get down fire again kill him now bucky hang on grab my hand sit down  what is this  steak what is in it cow doctor do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here i dont eat meat why not it disagrees with me how about cyanide does that give you the rumbly tummy too every hydra agent that weve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him but not you so here is my brilliant theory you want to live youre trying to intimidate me colonel i bought you dinner given the valuable information he has provided and in exchange for his full cooperation dr zola is being remanded to switzerland i sent that message to washington this morning of course it was encoded you guys havent broken those codes have you that would be awkward schmidt will know this is a lie hes going to kill you anyway doc youre a liability you know more about schmidt than anyone and the last guy you cost us was captain rogers closest friend so i wouldnt count on the very best of protection its you or schmidt its just the hand youve been dealt schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods only the world itself will satisfy him you do realize thats nuts dont you what the sanity of the plan is of no consequence  and why is that  because he can do it whats his target his target is everywhere tomorrow hydra will stand master of the world borne to victory on the wings of the valkyrie our enemies weapons will be powerless against us if they shoot down one plane hundreds more will rain fire upon them if they cut off one head two more shall take its place hail hydra  hail hydra  hail hydra  hail hydra hail hydra  hail hydra hail hydra blackout is still in effect throughout the london area please wait for the allclear your attention please all citizens shall remain indoors until further notice blackout is still in effect throughout the london area dr erskine said that the serum wouldnt just affect my muscles it would affect my cells create a protective system of regeneration and healing which means i cant get drunk did you know that your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person he thought it could be one of the side effects it wasnt your fault  did you read the report  yes then you know thats not true you did everything you could did you believe in your friend did you respect him then stop blaming yourself allow barnes the dignity of his choice he damn well must have thought you were worth it im going after schmidt im not gonna stop until all of hydra is dead or captured you wont be alone johann schmidt belongs in a bughouse he thinks hes a god and hes willing to blow up half the world to prove it starting with the usa schmidts working with powers beyond our capabilities he gets across the atlantic he will wipe out the entire eastern seaboard in an hour how much time we got according to my new best friend under  hours  where is he now  hydras last base is here in the alps  feet below the surface so what are we supposed to do i mean its not like we can just knock on the front door why not thats exactly what were going to do arrogance may not be a uniquely american trait but i must say you do it better than anyone but there are limits to what even you can do captain or did erskine tell you otherwise he told me you were insane he resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine but he gave you everything so what made you so special nothing im just a kid from brooklyn i can do this all day of course you can of course but unfortunately i am on a tight schedule so am i rogers you might need this thanks were in assault team go move out move keep your spacing cut off one head two more shall lets go find two more youre late  werent you about to  right get in  keep it steady  wait go get him im not kissing you  you dont

dodgers have three men on pearson beaned reiser in philadelphia last month wouldnt the youngster like a hit here to return the favor pete leans in heres the pitch swung on a line to the right and it

up here in front of you maybe ill do us all a favour and just stick to the cards theres been speculation that i was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop sorry mr stark do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards yes and this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed stark hightech powered battle i know that its confusing it is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations or insinuate that im a superhero i mean lets face it im not the heroic type a laundry list of character defects all the mistakes ive made largely public the truth is i am iron man ivan vanya  at  knots holding steady at  feet you are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone tony tony tony tony its good to be back  you missed me  blow something up i missed you too blow something up i already did that im not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me im not saying that from the ashes of captivity never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history im not saying that uncle sam can kick back on a lawn chair sipping on an iced tea because i havent come across anyone whos man enough to go toetotoe with me on my best day i love you tony please its not about me its not about you its not even about us its about legacy its about what we choose to leave behind for future generations and thats why for the next year and for the first time since  the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources share their collective vision to leave behind a brighter future its not about us

badge  you wanna see the badge he likes the badge  you still like it  yep  how far are we from dc  dc  miles mr stark could we pick up now where we left off mr stark please  yes dear  can i have your attention absolutely do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon  i do not i do not  you do not well it depends on how you define the word weapon  the iron man weapon  my device does not fit that description well how would you describe it i would describe it by defining it as what it is senator  as  its a hightech prosthesis that is that is thats actually the most apt description i can make of it its a weapon its a weapon mr stark please if your priority was actually the wellbeing of the american citizen my priority is to get the iron man weapon turned over to the people  of the united states of america  well you can forget it i am iron man the suit and i are one to turn over the iron man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution depending on what state youre in  you cant have it  look im no expert in prostitution of course not youre a senator come on im no expert in weapons we have somebody here who is an expert on weapons id now like to call justin hammer our current primary weapons contractor let the record reflect that i observed mr hammer entering the chamber and i am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance absolutely im no expert i defer to you anthony youre the wonder boy senator if i may i may well not be an expert but you know who was the expert your dad howard stark really a father to us all and to the militaryindustrial age lets just be clear he was no flower child he was a lion we all know why were here in the last six months anthony stark has created a sword with untold possibilities and yet he insists its a shield he asks us to trust him as we cower behind it i wish i were comforted anthony i really do id love to leave my door unlocked when i leave the house but this aint canada you know we live in a world of grave threats threats that mr stark will not always be able to foresee thank you god bless iron man god bless america that is well said mr hammer the committee would now like to invite lieutenant colonel james rhodes to the chamber rhodey what hey buddy i didnt expect to see you here look its me im here deal with it lets move on i just  drop it  all right ill drop it i have before me a complete report on the iron man weapon compiled by colonel rhodes and colonel for the record can you please read page  paragraph four youre requesting that i read specific selections  from my report senator  yes sir it was my understanding that i was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner i understand a lot of things have changed today  so if you could just read  you do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect  the summary of my final  just read it colonel i do thank you very well as he does not operate within any definable branch of government iron man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests i did however go on to summarise that the benefits of iron man far outweigh the liabilities  and that it would be in our interest  thats enough colonel to fold mr stark  thats enough into the existing chain of command senator im not a joiner but ill consider secretary of defense if you ask nice we can amend the hours a little bit id like to go on and show if i may the imagery thats connected to your report i believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images  to the general public at this time  with all due respect colonel i understand and if you could just narrate those for us wed be very grateful lets have the images intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are in fact attempts at making manned copies of mr starks suit this has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground indicating that these suits are quite possibly at this moment operational hold on one second buddy let me see something here boy im good i commandeered your screens i need them time for a little transparency  now lets see whats really going on  what is he doing if you will direct your attention to said screens i believe thats north korea can you turn that off take it off iran no grave immediate threat here is that justin hammer how did hammer get in the game justin youre on tv focus up okay give me a left twist lefts good turn to the right oh shit oh shit wow yeah id say most countries five  years away hammer industries  id like to point out that that test pilot survived i think were done is the point that hes making  i dont think theres any reason  the point is youre welcome i guess  for what  because im your nuclear deterrent its working were safe america is secure you want my property you cant have it but i did you a big favour ive successfully privatized world peace what more do you want for now i tried to play ball with these assclowns you mr stark you buddy were adjourned were adjourned for today  okay  youve been a delight my bond is with the people and i will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself if theres one thing ive proven its that you can count on me to pleasure myself wake up daddys home welcome home sir congratulations on the

stark family has destroyed speaking of thieves where did you get this design my father anton vanko well i never heard of him my father is the reason youre alive the reason im alive is cause you had a

selfdestructive tendencies i was dying i mean please and arent we all textbook narcissism agreed okay here it is recruitment assessment for avenger initiative iron man yes  i gotta think about it  read on tony stark not not recommended that doesnt make any sense how can you approve me but not approve me i got a new ticker im trying to do right by pepper im in a stableish relationship which leads us to believe at this juncture wed only like to use you as a consultant you cant afford me then again i will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour rhodey and i are being honoured in washington and we need a presenter ill see what i can do it is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to lieutenant colonel james rhodes and mr tony stark who is of course a national treasure thank you lieutenant colonel for such an exceptionally distinguished performance  you deserve this  thank you sir mr stark thank you for such an exceptionally distinguished performance you deserve this oh sorry funny how annoying a little prick can be isnt it lets get a photo sir weve found itthe tesseract has awakened it is on a little world a human world they would wield its power but our ally knows its workings as they never will he is ready to lead and our force our chitauri will follow a world will be his the universe yours and the humans what can they do but burn all personnel the evacuation order has been confirmed how bad is it thats the problem sir we dont know dr selvig read an energy surge from the tesseract four hours ago nasa didnt authorise selvig to go to test phase he wasnt testing it he wasnt even in the room spontaneous event it just turned itself on where are the energy levels now climbing when selvig couldnt shut it down we ordered evac how long to get everyone out campus should be clear in the next halfhour do better sir evacuation may be futile we should tell them to go back to sleep if we cant control the tesseracts energy there may not be a minimum safe distance i need you to make sure the phase  prototypes are shipped out sir is that really a priority right now until such time as the world ends we will act as though it intends to spin on clear out the tech below every piece of phase  on a truck and gone yes sir with me talk to me doctor director is there anything we know for certain the tesseract is misbehaving  is that supposed to be funny  no its not funny at all the tesseract is not only active shes behaving i assume you pulled the plug shes an energy source we turn off the power she turns it back on if she reaches peak level we prepared for this doctor harnessing energy from space but we dont have the harness my calculations are far from complete and shes throwing off interference radiation nothing harmful low levels of gamma radiation that can be harmful wheres agent barton the hawk up in his nest as usual agent barton report i gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things well i see better from a distance have you seen anything that might set this thing off doctor its spiking again no ones come or gone and selvigs clean no contacts no ims if there was any tampering sir it wasnt at this end at this end yeah the cube is a doorway to the other end of space right doors open from both sides not yet sir please put down the spear you have heart please dont i still need that this doesnt have to get any messier of course it does ive come too far for anything else i am loki of asgard and i am burdened with glorious purpose loki brother of thor we have no quarrel with your people an ant has no quarrel with a boot are you planning to step on us i come with glad tidings of a world made free free from what freedom freedom is lifes great lie once you accept that in your heart you will know peace yeah you say peace i kind of think you mean the other thing sir director fury is stalling this place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us he means to bury us like the pharaohs of old hes right the portal is collapsing in on itself weve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical well then i need these vehicles  whos that  they didnt tell me hill do you copy barton has turned they have the tesseract shut them down okay lets go no leave it go were clear upstairs sir you need to go director director fury do you copy the tesseract is with a hostile force i have men down hill a lot of men still under i dont know how many survivors sound a general call i want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase roger that coulson get back to base this is a level seven as of right now we are at war what do we do this is not how i wanted this evening to go i know how you wanted this evening to go believe me this is better who are you working for lermentov yes does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo i thought general solohob is in charge of the export business solohob a bagman a front your outdated information betrays you the famous black widow and she turns out to be simply another pretty face you really think im pretty tell lermentov we dont need him to move the tanks tell him he is out well you may have to write it down its for her you listen carefully youre at   silensky plaza rd floor we have an f exactly eight miles out put the woman on the phone or i will blow up the block before you can make the lobby  we need you to come in  are you kidding im working this takes precedence im in the middle of an interrogation this moron is giving me everything i dont give everything look you cant pull me out of this right now natasha bartons been compromised let me put you on hold where is barton now  we dont know  but hes alive we think so ill brief you on everything when you get back but first we need you to talk to the big guy coulson you know that stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me ive got stark you get the big guy who are you get out there is sickness here youre a doctor my fathers not waking up he has a fever and hes moaning but his eyes wont open slow down my father like them please you shouldve got paid up front banner you know for a man whos supposed to be avoiding stress you picked a hell of a place to settle avoiding stress isnt the secret then what is it yoga you brought me to the edge of the city smart i assume the whole place is surrounded just you and me and your actress buddy is she a spy too they start that young i did who are you natasha romanoff are you here to kill me ms romanoff because thats not going to work out for everyone no of course not im here on behalf of shield shield how did they find me we never lost you doctor weve kept our distance even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent why nick fury seems to trust you but now we need you to come in what if i say no ill persuade you and what if the other guy says no youve been more than a year without an incident i dont think you want to break that streak well i dont every time get what i want doctor were facing a potential global catastrophe well those i actively try to avoid this is the tesseract it has the potential energy to wipe out the planet what does fury want me to do swallow it he wants you to find it its been taken it emits a gamma signature thats too weak for us to trace theres no one that knows gamma radiation like you do if there was thats where id be so fury isnt after the monster not that hes told me and he tells you everything talk to fury he needs you on this he needs me in a cage no ones going to put you in a stop lying to me im sorry that was mean i just wanted to see what youd do why dont we do this the easy way where you dont use that and the other guy doesnt make a mess okay natasha stand down were good here just you and me this is out of line director youre dealing with forces you cant control you ever been in a war councilman in a firefight did you feel an overabundance of control youre saying that this asgard is declaring war on our planet not asgard loki he cant be working alone what about the other one his brother our intelligence says thor is not a hostile but hes worlds away we cant depend on him to help either its up to us which is why you should be focusing on phase  it was designed for exactly this phase  isnt ready our enemy is we need a response team the avengers initiative was shut down this isnt about the avengers weve seen the list youre running the worlds greatest covert security network and youre going to leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks im not leaving anything to anyone we need a response team these people may be isolated unbalanced even but i believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need you believe war isnt won by sentiment director no its won by soldiers theres not enough time i got to put her in the water you wont be alone oh my god this guy is still alive trouble sleeping i slept for  years sir i think ive had my fill then you should be out celebrating seeing the world when i went under the world was at war i wake up they say we won they didnt say what we lost weve made some mistakes along the way some very recently are you here with a mission sir i am trying to get me back in the world trying to save it hydras secret weapon howard stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you he thought what we think the tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy thats something the world sorely needs who took it from you hes called loki hes not from around here theres a lot well have to bring you up to speed on if youre in the world has gotten even stranger than you already know at this point i doubt anything would surprise me ten bucks says youre wrong theres a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment is there anything you can tell us about the tesseract that we ought to know now you should have left it in the ocean good to go on this end the rest is up to you you disconnected the transmission lines are we off the grid stark tower is about to become a beacon of selfsustaining clean energy well assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works i assume light her up how does it look like christmas but with more me weve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign you need to do some press im in dc tomorrow im working on the zoning for the next three buildings pepper youre killing me the moment remember enjoy the moment get in here and i will sir agent coulson of shield is on the line im not in im actually out sir im afraid hes insisting grow a spine jarvis i got a date levels are holding steady i think of course they are i was directly involved which brings me to my next question how does it feel to be a genius well i really wouldnt know now would i what do you mean all this came from you no all this came from that give yourself some credit please stark tower is your baby give yourself  of the credit  an argument can be made for   my baby well i did do all the heavy lifting literally i lifted the heavy things and sorry but the security snafu that was on you  my private elevator  you mean our elevator it was teeming with sweaty workmen im going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later arent i its not going to be that subtle ill tell you what the next building is gonna say potts on the tower on the lease call your mom can you bunk over sir the telephone im afraid my protocols are being overridden mr stark we need to talk you have reached the life model decoy of tony stark  please leave a message  this is urgent then leave it urgently security breach its on you  mr stark  phil come in phil i cant stay his first name is agent come on in were celebrating which is why he cant stay we need you to look this over as soon as possible i dont like being handed things thats fine because i love to be handed things so lets trade thank you official consulting hours are between  and  every other thursday this isnt a consultation is this about the avengers which i know nothing about the avengers initiative was scrapped i thought and i didnt even qualify i didnt know that either apparently im volatile selfobsessed dont play well with others that i did know this isnt about personality profiles any more whatever ms potts got a second half a mo you know i thought we were having a moment i was having  of a moment this seems serious phils pretty shaken how would you know if its why is he phil what is all this this is this im going to take the jet to dc tonight tomorrow you have homework you have a lot of homework well what if i didnt  lf you didnt  yeah you mean when youve finished well then square deal fly safe work hard so any chance youre driving by laguardia  i can drop you  fantastic i want to hear about the cellist is that still a thing she moved back to portland what boo were about  minutes out from home base sir so this dr banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me a lot of people were you were the worlds first superhero banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking erskines original formula didnt really go his way did it not so much when hes not that thing though the guys like a stephen hawking hes like a smart person i gotta say its an honour to meet you officially ive sort of met you i mean i watched you while you were sleeping i mean i was present while you were unconscious from the ice you know its really just a huge honour to have you on board this i hope im the man for the job oh you are absolutely we made some modifications to the uniform i had a little design input the uniform arent the stars and stripes a little oldfashioned with everything thats happening and the things that are about to come to light people might just need a little oldfashioned the chitauri grow restless let them gird themselves i will lead them in the glorious battle battle against the meagre might of earth glorious not lengthy if your force is as formidable as you claim you question us you question him he who put the sceptre in your hand who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out defeated i was a king the rightful king of asgard betrayed your ambition is little and born of childish need we look beyond the earth to the greater worlds the tesseract will unveil you dont have the tesseract yet i dont threaten but until i open the doors until your force is mine to command you are but words you will have your war asgardian if you fail if the tesseract is kept from us there will be no realm no barren moon no crevice where he cannot find you you think you know pain he will make you long for something sweet as pain stow the captains gear yes sir agent romanoff captain rogers  maam  hi they need you on the bridge theyre starting the facetrace see you there it was quite the buzz around here finding you in the ice i thought coulson was gonna swoon did he ask you to sign his captain america trading cards yet trading cards theyre vintage hes very proud dr banner yeah hi they told me you would be coming word is you can find the cube is that the only word on me only word i care about it must be strange for you all of this well this is actually kind of familiar gentlemen you might want to step inside in a minute its going to get a little hard to breathe flight crew secure the deck is this a submarine really they want me in a submerged pressurised metal container no no this is much worse hover power check complete position cyclic increase collective to  preparing for maximum performance takeoff increase output to capacity power plant performing at capacity we are clear all engines operating shield emergency protocol  in effect  we are at level sir  good lets vanish engage retroreflection panels reflection panels engaged gentlemen doctor thank you for coming thanks for asking nicely so how long am i staying once we get our hands on the tesseract youre in the wind where are you with that were sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet cell phones laptops if its connected to a satellite its eyes and ears for us thats still not gonna find them in time you have to narrow your field how many spectrometers do you have access to  how many are there  call every lab you know tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays ill rough out a tracking algorithm basic cluster recognition at least we could rule out a few places do you have somewhere for me to work agent romanoff could you show dr banner to his laboratory please youre gonna love it doc we got all the toys put it over there where did you find all these people shield has no shortage of enemies doctor is this the stuff you need yeah iridium its found in meteorites it forms antiprotons its very hard to get hold of especially if shield knows you need it well i didnt know hey the tesseract has shown me so much its more than knowledge its truth i know what did it show you agent barton my next target tell me what you need i need a distraction and an eyeball i mean if its not too much trouble no no its fine its a vintage set it took me a couple of years to collect them all near mint slight foxing around the edges but we got a hit a  match wait cross match  location stuttgart germany  königstrasse hes not exactly hiding captain youre up kneel before me i said kneel is not this simpler is this not your natural state its the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation the bright lure of freedom diminishes your lifes joy in a mad scramble for power for identity you were made to be ruled in the end you will always kneel not to men like you there are no men like me there are always men like you look to your elder people let him be an example you know the last time i was in germany and saw a man standing above everybody else we ended up disagreeing the soldier the man out of time im not the one whos out of time loki drop the weapon and stand down kneel not today the guys all over the place agent romanoff you miss me make your move reindeer games good move mr stark captain is he saying anything not a word just get him here were low on time i dont like it what rock of ages giving up so easily i dont remember it being that easy this guy packs a wallop still you are pretty spry for an older fellow whats your thing pilates what its like calisthenics you might have missed a couple of things doing time as a capsicle fury didnt tell me he was calling you in yeah theres a lot of things fury doesnt tell you wheres this coming from whats the matter are you scared of a little lightning im not overly fond of what follows what are you doing and now theres that guy another asgardian  that guys a friendly  doesnt matter if he frees loki or kills him the tesseracts lost stark we need a plan of attack i have a plan attack id sit this one out cap i dont see how i can these guys come from legend theyre basically gods theres only one god maam and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that where is the tesseract i missed you too do i look to be in a gaming mood you should thank me with the bifrost gone how much dark energy did the allfather have to muster to conjure you here to your precious earth i thought you dead did you mourn we all did our father your father he did tell you my true parentage did he not we were raised together we played together we fought together do you remember none of that i remember a shadow living in the shade of your greatness i remember you tossing me into an abyss i who was and should be king so you take the world i love as a recompense for your imagined slights no the earth is under my protection loki and youre doing a marvellous job with that the humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly fret i mean to rule them as why should i not you think yourself above them well yes then you miss the truth of ruling brother a throne would suit you ill ive seen worlds youve never known about i have grown odinson in my exile i have seen the true power of the tesseract and when i wield it who showed you this power who controls the wouldbe king  i am a king  not here you give up the tesseract you give up this poisonous dream you come home i dont have it you need the cube to bring me home but ive sent it off i know not where you listen well brother im listening do not touch me again then dont take my stuff you have no idea what youre dealing with shakespeare in the park doth mother know you weareth her drapes this is beyond you metal man loki will face asgardian justice he gives up the cube hes all yours until then stay out of the way tourist okay power at  capacity how about that hey thats enough now i dont know what you plan on doing here ive come here to put an end to lokis schemes then prove it put that hammer down yeah no bad call he loves his hammer you want me to put the hammer down are we done here in case its unclear if you try to escape if you so much as scratch that glass its  feet straight down in a steel trap you get how that works ant boot its an impressive cage not built i think for me built for something a lot stronger than you oh ive heard a mindless beast makes play hes still a man how desperate are you that you call on such lost creatures to defend you how desperate am i you threaten my world with war you steal a force you cant hope to control you talk about peace and you kill because its fun you have made me very desperate you might not be glad that you did it burns you to have come so close to have the tesseract to have power unlimited power and for what a warm light for all mankind to share and then to be reminded what real power is well let me know if real power wants a magazine or something he really grows on you doesnt he lokis gonna drag this out so thor whats his play he has an army called the chitauri theyre not of asgard nor any world known he means to lead them against your people they will win him the earth in return i suspect for the tesseract an army from outer space so hes building another portal thats what he needs erik selvig for selvig  hes an astrophysicist  hes a friend loki has him under some kind of spell along with one of ours i want to know why loki let us take him hes not leading an army from here i dont think we should be focusing on loki that guys brain is a bag full of cats you could smell crazy on him have care how you speak loki is beyond reason but he is of asgard and he is my brother he killed  people in two days hes adopted i think its about the mechanics iridium what do they need the iridium for its a stabilising agent im just saying pick a weekend ill fly you to portland keep love alive it means the portal wont collapse on itself like it did at shield no hard feelings point break youve got a mean swing also it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as loki wants raise the mizzenmast jib the topsails that man is playing galaga he thought we wouldnt notice but we did how does fury even see these he turns sounds exhausting the rest of the raw materials agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily the only major component he still needs is a power source of highenergy density something to kickstart the cube when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics last night the packet selvigs notes the extraction theory papers am i the only one who did the reading does loki need any particular kind of power source he would have to heat the cube to million kelvin just to break through the coulomb barrier unless selvig has figured out how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect well if he could do that he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet finally someone who speaks english is that what just happened its good to meet you dr banner your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled and im a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green ragemonster thanks dr banner is only here to track the cube i was hoping you might join him i would start with that stick of his it may be magical but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon i dont know about that but it is powered by the cube and i would like to know how loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys monkeys i do not understand i do i understood that reference shall we play doctor this way sir the gamma readings are definitely consistent with selvigs reports of the tesseract but its going to take weeks to process if we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the homer cluster we can clock this at around  teraflops all i packed was a toothbrush you know you should come by stark tower sometime top ten floors all rd youd love it its candy land thanks but the last time i was in new york i kind of broke harlem well i promise a stressfree environment no tension no surprises  hey  nothing are you nuts jurys out you really have got a lid on it havent you whats your secret mellow jazz bongo drums huge bag of weed is everything a joke to you funny things are threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isnt funny no offence doc its all right i wouldnt have come aboard if i couldnt handle pointy things youre tiptoeing big man you need to strut and you need to focus on the problem mr stark do you think im not why did fury call us in why now why not before what isnt he telling us i cant do the equation unless i have all the variables you think furys hiding something hes a spy captain hes the spy his secrets have secrets its bugging him too isnt it i just want to finish my work here and doctor a warm light for all mankind lokis jab at fury about the cube i heard it i think that was meant for you even if barton didnt tell loki about the tower it was still all over the news the stark tower that big ugly building in new york its powered by an arc reactor a selfsustaining energy source that building will run itself for what a year its just the prototype im kind of the only name in clean energy right now thats what hes getting at so why didnt shield bring him in on the tesseract project what are they doing in the energy business in the first place i should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of shields secure files im sorry did you say jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge in a few hours ill know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide blueberry yet youre confused about why they didnt want you around an intelligence organisation that fears intelligence historically not awesome i think lokis trying to wind us up this is a man who means to start a war and if we dont stay focused hell succeed we have orders we should follow them followings not really my style and youre all about style arent you of the people in this room which one is a wearing a spangly outfit and b not of use steve tell me none of this smells a little funky to you just find the cube thats the guy my dad never shut up about im wondering if they shouldnt have kept him on ice the guys not wrong about loki he does have the jump on us what hes got is an acme dynamite kit its going to blow up in his face and im going to be there when it does yeah ill read all about it or youll be suiting up with the rest of us you see i dont get a suit of armour im exposed like a nerve its a nightmare ive got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second to crawl its way into my heart this stops it this little circle of light its part of me now not just armour its a terrible privilege  but you can control it  because i learned how its different hey i read all about your accident that much gamma exposure should have killed you so youre saying that the hulk the other guy saved my life thats nice its a nice sentiment saved it for what i guess well find out you may not enjoy that and you just might as soon as loki took the doctor we moved jane foster theyve got an excellent observatory in tromsø she was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday handsome fee private plane very remote shell be safe thank you its no accident loki taking erik selvig i dread what he plans for him once hes done erik is a good man he talks about you a lot you changed his life you changed everything around here they were better as they were we pretend on asgard that were more advanced but we come here battling like bilge snipe  like what  bilge snipe you know huge scaly big antlers  you dont have those  i dont think so well they are repulsive and they trample everything in their path when i first came to earth lokis rage followed me here and your people paid the price and now again in my youth i courted war war hasnt started yet you think you could make loki tell us where the tesseract is i do not know lokis mind is far afield its not just power he craves its vengeance upon me theres no pain would prise his need from him a lot of guys think that until the pain starts what are you asking me to do im asking what are you prepared to do loki is a prisoner then why do i feel like hes the only person on this boat that wants to be here theres not many people who can sneak up on me but you figured id come after after whatever tortures fury can concoct you would appear as a friend as a balm and i would cooperate i want to know what youve done to agent barton i would say ive expanded his mind and once youve won once youre king of the mountain what happens to his mind is this love agent romanoff love is for children i owe him a debt tell me before i worked for shiel d i well i made a name for myself i have a very specific skill set i didnt care who i used it for or on i got on shields radar in a bad way agent barton was sent to kill me he made a different call and what will you do if i vow to spare him not let you out no but i like this your world in the balance and you bargain for one man regimes fall every day i tend not to weep over that im russian or i was and what are you now its really not that complicated i got red in my ledger id like to wipe it out can you can you wipe out that much red dreykovs daughter são paulo the hospital fire barton told me everything your ledger is dripping its gushing red and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything this is the basest sentimentality this is a child at prayer pathetic you lie and kill in the service of liars and killers you pretend to be separate to have your own code something that makes up for the horrors but they are part of you and they will never go away i wont touch barton not until i make him kill you slowly intimately in every way he knows you fear and then hell wake just long enough to see his good work and when he screams ill split his skull this is my bargain you mewling quim youre a monster oh no you brought the monster so banner thats your play what loki means to unleash the hulk keep banner in the lab im on my way send thor as well thank you for your cooperation what are you doing mr stark kind of been wondering the same thing about you youre supposed to be locating the tesseract we are the models locked and were sweeping for the signature now when we get a hit well have the location within half a mile yeah then you get your cube back no muss no fuss what is phase  phase  is shield uses the cube to make weapons sorry computer was moving a little slow for me rogers we gathered everything related to the tesseract this does not mean that were making im sorry nick what were you lying i was wrong director the world hasnt changed a bit did you know about this you want to think about removing yourself from this environment doctor i was in calcutta i was pretty well removed loki is manipulating you and youve been doing what exactly you didnt come here because i bat my eyelashes at you yes and im not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy id like to know why shield is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction because of him me last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that levelled a small town we learned that not only are we not alone but we are hopelessly hilariously outgunned my people want nothing but peace with your planet but youre not the only people out there are you and youre not the only threat the worlds filling up with people who cant be matched that cant be controlled like you controlled the cube your work with the tesseract is what drew loki to it and his allies it is a signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war a higher form you forced our hand we had to come up with something a nuclear deterrent because that always calms everything right down remind me again how you made your fortune stark im sure if he still made weapons stark would be neckdeep hold on how is this now about me im sorry isnt everything i thought humans were more evolved than this excuse me did we come to your planet and blow stuff up you treat your champions with such mistrust are you boys really that naïve shield monitors potential threats captain americas on threat watch we all are wait youre on

get you to sign them were dead in the air up here our communications the location of the cube banner thor i got nothing for you i lost my one good eye maybe i had that coming yes we were going to build an arsenal with the tesseract i never put all my chips on that number though because i was playing something even riskier there was an idea stark knows this called the avengers initiative the idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more to see if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles that we never could phil coulson died still believing in that idea in heroes well its an oldfashioned notion you fell out of the sky did i hurt anybody theres nobody around here to get hurt you did scare the hell out of some pigeons though lucky or just good aim you were awake when you fell  you saw  the whole thing right through the ceiling big and green and buckass nude here didnt think those would fit you until

ask hes going to make his play soon though today we got to stop him yeah whos we i dont know whoevers left well if i put an arrow through lokis eye socket i would sleep better i suppose now you sound like you but you dont youre a spy not a soldier now you want to wade into a war why what did loki do to you he didnt i just natasha ive been compromised i got red in my ledger i would like to wipe it out was he married no there was a cellist i think im sorry he seemed like a good man he was an idiot why for believing for taking on loki alone he was doing his job he was out of his league he should have waited he should have sometimes there isnt a way out tony right ive heard that before is this the first time you lost a soldier we are not soldiers im not marching to furys fife neither am i hes got the same blood on his hands that loki does but right now we got to put that behind us and get this done loki needs a power source if we can put together a list he made it personal thats not the point that is the point thats lokis point he hit us all right where we live why to tear us apart yeah divide and conquer is great but he knows he has to take us out to win right thats what he wants he wants to beat us he wants to be seen doing it he wants an audience right i caught his act in stuttgart yeah that was just previews this is opening night and loki hes a fulltilt diva right he wants flowers he wants parades he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered son of a bitch time to go  go where  ill tell you on the way can you fly one of those jets i can you got a suit

chitauri are coming nothing will change that what have i to fear the avengers thats what we call ourselves were sort of like a team earths mightiest heroestype thing yes ive met them yeah it takes us a while to get any traction ill give you that one but lets do a head count here your brother the demigod a super soldier a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend a man with breathtaking angermanagement issues a couple of master assassins and you big fella youve managed to piss off every single one of them that was the plan not a great plan when they come and they will theyll come for you i have an army we have a hulk i thought the beast had wandered off youre missing the point there is no throne there is no version of this where you come out on top maybe your army comes and maybe its too much for us but its all on you because if we cant protect the earth you can be damn well sure well avenge it how will your friends have time for me when they are so busy fighting you this usually works well performance issues its not uncommon one out of five jarvis anytime now you will all fall before me deploy deploy and theres one other person you pissed off his name was phil right

pleasure just like budapest all over again you and i remember budapest very differently its going to be an hour before they can scramble the national guard national guard does the army know whats happening here do we you need men in these buildings there are people inside and theyre going to be running right into the line of fire you take them to the basements or through the subway you keep them off the streets i need a perimeter as far back as th why the hell should i take orders from you i need men in those buildings lead the people down and away from the streets were going to set up a perimeter all the way down to th street well we got its attention what the hell was step two whats the story upstairs the power surrounding the cube is impenetrable thors right we got to deal with these guys  how do we do this  as a team i have unfinished business with loki yeah well get in line save it lokis going to keep this fight focused on us and thats what we need without him these things

to need a ride i got a ride i could use a boost though are you sure about this yeah its gonna be fun okay turn turn less less captain the bank on nd past madison theyve cornered a lot of civilians in there im on it everyone clear out director fury the council has made a decision i recognise the council has made a decision but given that its a stupidass decision i have elected to ignore it director youre closer than any of our subs you scramble that jet that is the island of manhattan councilman until im certain my team cant hold it i will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population if we dont hold them here we lose everything if i send that bird out we already have you hawkeye nat what are you doing a little help i got him enough you are all of you beneath me i am a god you dull creature and i will not be bullied by puny god the sceptre doctor lokis sceptre the energy the tesseract cant fight but you cant protect against yourself its not your fault you didnt know what you were doing actually i think i did i built in a safety to cut their power source lokis sceptre it may be able to close the portal and im looking right at it sir we will lose power before we penetrate that shell jarvis you ever hear the tale of jonah i wouldnt consider him a role model director fury is no longer in command override order alpha    alpha   confirmed were go for takeoff sir we have a bird in motion anyone on the deck we have a rogue bird we need to shut it down repeat takeoff is not authorised stark do you hear me you have a missile headed straight for the city how long three

a minute and i know just where to put it stark you know thats a oneway trip save the rest for the turn j sir shall i try miss potts might as well the streets of new york city have become a battleground the army is here trying to contain the violence but clearly it is outmatched and i have to say in all my years of reporting i have never seen anything like this we have limited information on the team but we do know that billionaire tony starks iron man come on stark close it son of a gun hes not slowing down is he breathing what the hell what just happened please tell me nobody kissed me we won all right yay hurray good job guys lets just not come in tomorrow lets just take a day have you ever tried shawarma theres a shawarma joint about two blocks from here i dont know what it is but i want to try it were not finished yet and then shawarma after if its all the same to you ill have that drink now despite the devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the avengers has been to many a cause not only for comfort but for celebration its just really great knowing theyre out there that someone is watching over us i love you thor and then these guys were like and then the air goes and this green guy walks up and he goes i dont know i dont exactly feel safer with those things out there it just seems that theres a lot theyre not telling us superheroes in new york give me a break these socalled heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city this was their fight where are they now tough questions are being asked about the avengers themselves their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance what this is all somehow their fault captain america saved my life wherever he is and wherever any of them are i would just i would want to say thank you where are the avengers im not currently tracking their whereabouts id say theyve earned a leave of absence and the tesseract the tesseract is where it belongs out of our reach thats not your call i didnt make it i just didnt argue with the god that did so you let him take it and the war criminal loki who should be answering for his crime i think he will be i dont think you understand what youve started letting the avengers loose on this world theyre dangerous they surely are and the whole world knows it every world knows it was that the point of all this a statement a promise sir how does it work now theyve gone their separate ways some pretty extremely far if we get into a situation like this again what happens then theyll come back are you really sure about that i am why because well need them to humans they are not the cowering wretches we were promised they stand they are unruly and therefore cannot be ruled to challenge them is to court deaththis is the asgardian refugee vessel statesman we are under assault i repeat we are under assault the engines are dead life support failing requesting aid from any vessel within range we are  jump points out of asgard our crew is made up of asgardian families we have very few soldiers here this is not a warcraft i repeat this is not a warcraft hear me and rejoice you have had the privilege of being saved by the great titan you may think this is suffering no it is salvation universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice smile for even in death you have become children of thanos i know what its like to lose to feel so desperately that youre right yet to fail nonetheless its frightening turns the legs to jelly but i ask you to what end dread it run from it destiny arrives all the same and now its here or should i say i am you talk too much the tesseract or your brothers head i assume you have a preference oh i do kill away all right stop we dont have the tesseract it was destroyed on asgard you really are the worst brother i assure you brother the sun will shine on us again your optimism is misplaced asgardian well for one thing im not asgardian and for another we have a hulk  let him have his fun allfathers let the dark magic flow through me one last time that was a mistake no youre going to die for that shh my humble personage bows before your grandeur no other being has ever had the might nay the nobility to wield not one but two infinity stones the universe lies

space reality power soul mind and time tell me his name again thanos hes a plague tony he invades planets he takes what he wants he wipes out half the population he sent loki the attack on new york thats him this is it whats our timeline no telling he has the power and space stones that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe if he gets his hands on all six stones tony he could destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of did you seriously just say hitherto undreamt of are you seriously leaning on the cauldron of the cosmos  is that what it is im going to allow that if thanos needs all six why dont we just stick this one down a garbage disposal no can do we swore an oath to protect the time stone with our lives and i swore off dairy but then ben  jerrys named a flavor after me  stark raving hazelnuts  not bad a bit chalky a hunk of hulk of burning fudge is our favorite  thats a thing  whatever point is things change our oath to protect the time stone cannot change and this stone may be the best chance we have against thanos yeah so conversely it may also be his best chance against us well if we dont do our jobs what is your job exactly besides making balloon animals protecting your reality douchebag okay guys could we table this discussion right now the fact is we have this stone we know where it is vision is out there somewhere with the mind stone and we have to find him now yeah thats the thing what do you mean two weeks ago vision turned off his transponder hes offline  what  yeah tony you lost another superbot i didnt lose him hes more

happened oh my god looks like were not getting paid wipers wipers get it off how the hell is this dude still alive he is not a dude youre a dude this this is a man a handsome muscular man im muscular but who are you kidding quill youre one sandwich away from fat yeah right its true quill you have put on weight what gamora do you think im he is anxious angry he feels tremendous loss and guilt its like a pirate had a baby with an angel wow this is a real wakeup call for me okay im gonna get a bowflex im gonna commit im gonna get some dumbbells you know you cant eat dumbbells right its like his muscles are made of cotati metal fibers stop massaging his muscles wake him up wake who the hell are you guys the entire time i knew thanos he only ever had one goal to bring balance to the universe by wiping out half of all life he used to kill people planet by planet massacre by massacre including my own if he gets all six infinity stones he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this you seem to know a great deal about thanos gamora is the daughter of thanos your father killed my brother oh boy stepfather technically and she hates him as much as you do families can be tough before my father died he told me that i had a halfsister that he imprisoned in hel and then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye so i had to kill her thats life though isnt it i guess goes round and round and i feel your pain i feel your pain as well because i mean its not a competition but ive been through a lot  my father killed my mother and then i had to kill my father  that was hard probably even harder than having to kill a sister plus i came out with both my eyes which was i need a hammer not a spoon how do i open this thing is there some sort of uh a fourdigit code maybe maybe a birthdate  uh what are you doing  taking your pod no youre not you will not be taking our pod today sir uh quill are you making your voice deeper  no  you are youre imitating the godman its weird no im not he just did it again  this is my voice are you mocking me  are you mocking me  stop it you did it again hes trying to copy me i need you to stop doing that enough  hes doing it first we need to stop thanos which means we need to find out where hes going next knowhere he must be going somewhere no no knowhere its a place weve been there it sucks  excuse me thats our food  not anymore thor why would he go to knowhere because for years the reality stones been safely stored there with a man called the collector if its with the collector then its not safe only an idiot would give that man a stone  or a genius  how do you know hes not going for one of the other stones there are six stones out there thanos already has the power stone because he stole it last week when he decimated xandar he stole the space stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people the time and mind stones are safe on earth theyre with the avengers  the avengers  earths mightiest heroes like kevin bacon he may be on the team i dont know i havent been there in a while as for the soul stone well no ones ever seen that no one even knows where it is therefore thanos cant get it therefore hes going to knowhere hence hell be getting the reality stone youre welcome then we have to go to knowhere now wrong where we have to go is nidavellir  thats a madeup word  all words are made up nidavellir is real seriously that place is a legend they make the most powerful horrific weapons to ever torment the universe i would very much like to go there please the rabbit is correct and clearly the smartest among you rabbit only eitri the dwarf can make me the weapon i need i assume youre the captain sir youre very perceptive you seem like a noble leader will you join me on my quest to nidavellir let me just ask the captain oh wait a second its me  yeah ill go  wonderful uh except for that im the captain quiet  thats my backpack  go sit down look this is my ship and im not goin to wait what kinda weapon are we talkin about here the thanoskilling kind dont you think that we should all have a weapon like that no you simply lack the strength to wield them your bodies would crumble as your minds collapsed into madness is it weird that i wanna do it even more now mmm a little bit yeah if we dont go to knowhere and thanos retrieves another stone hell be too powerful to stop  he already is  i got it figured out we got two ships and a large assortment of morons so me and groot will go with the pirate angel here and the morons will go to knowhere to try to stop thanos  cool cool  so cool for the record i know that youre going with him because its where thanos isnt you know you really shouldnt talk that way to your captain quill come on groot put that game down youll rot your brain i bid you farewell and good luck morons bye vis is it the stone again its as if its speaking to me what does it say i dont i dont know but something  hey tell me what you feel i just feel you so theres a  am to glasgow which would give us more time together before you went back what if i miss that train theres an  what if i missed all the trains what if this time i didnt go back but you gave stark your word id rather give it to you well there are people who are expecting me too you know we both made promises not to each other wanda for two years weve stolen these moments

only criminals because youve chosen to call them that right sir my god rhodes your talent for horseshit rivals my own if it werent for those accords vision wouldve been right here i remember your signature on those papers colonel thats right and im pretty sure i paid for that you have second thoughts not anymore mr secretary you got some nerve ill give you that you could use some of that right now the worlds on fire and you think all is forgiven im not looking for forgiveness and im way past asking permission earth just lost her best defender so were here to fight and if you wanna stand in

hotels werent exactly five star uh i think you look great uh yeah im back hi bruce nat this is awkward so we gotta assume theyre coming back right and they can clearly find us we need all hands on deck wheres clint after the whole accords situation he and scott took a deal it was too tough on their families theyre on house arrest  whos scott  antman theres an antman and a spiderman okay look thanos has the biggest army in the universe and he is not gonna stop until he gets visions stone then we have to protect it no we have to destroy it ive been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head about its nature but also its composition i think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source something very similar to its own signature perhaps its molecular integrity could fail yeah and you with it were not having this conversation eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that thanos cant get it thats too high a price only you have the power to pay it thanos threatens half the universe one life cannot stand in the way of defeating him but it should we dont trade lives vision captain  years ago you laid down your life to save how many millions of people tell me why is this any different because you might have a choice your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays jarvis ultron tony me the stone all of them mixed together all of them learning from one another youre saying vision isnt just the stone im saying that if we take out the stone theres still a whole lot of vision left perhaps the best parts can we do that not me not here well you better find someone and somewhere fast ross isnt just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back i know somewhere the kingsguard and the dora milaje have been alerted and the border tribe those that are left send word to the jabari as well mbaku likes a good fight and what of this one this one may be tired of war but the white wolf has rested long enough wheres the fight on its way in all the time ive served thanos i have never failed him if i were to reach our rendezvous on titan with the time stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person there would be judgment give me the stone wow youre a seriously loyal piece of outerwear arent you yeah uh speaking of loyalty what the  i know what youre gonna say  you should not be here  i was gonna go home  i dont wanna hear it but it was such a long way down and i just thought  about you on the way  and now i gotta hear it and kinda stuck to the side of the ship and this suit is ridiculously intuitive by the way god damn it so if anything its kinda your fault that im here  what did you just say  i take that back and now im here in space yeah right where i didnt want you to be this isnt coney island this isnt a field trip this is a oneway ticket you hear me dont pretend you thought this through no i did think this through you could not have possibly thought this through you cant be a friendly neighborhood spiderman if theres no neighborhood okay that didnt really make sense but you know what im trying to say come on we got a situation see him down there hes in trouble whats your plan  go  um okay okay uh okay did you ever see this really old movie aliens painful arent they they were originally designed for microsurgery  and any one of them could end your friends life in an instant i gotta tell you hes not really my friend saving his life is more of a professional courtesy youve saved nothing your powers are inconsequential compared to mine yeah but the kids seen more movies yes wait what are those hey we havent officially met cool we gotta turn this ship around yeah now he wants to run great plan no i want to protect the stone and i want you to thank me now go ahead im listening for what nearly blasting me into space who just saved your magical ass me i seriously dont know how you fit your head into that helmet admit it you shouldve ducked out when i told you to i tried to bench you you refused unlike everyone else in your life i dont work for you and due to that fact were now in a flying doughnut billions of miles from earth with no backup  im backup  no youre a stowaway the adults are talking im sorry im confused as to the relationship here what is he your ward no  im peter by the way  doctor strange oh youre using our madeup names um im spiderman then this ship is selfcorrecting its course things on autopilot can we control it fly us home  stark  yeah can you get us home yeah i heard you im thinking im not so sure we should under no circumstances can we bring the time stone to thanos i dont think you quite understand whats at stake here what no its you who doesnt understand that thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to new york and now hes back and i dont know what to do so im not so sure if its a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did what they can do at least on his turf hes not expecting it so i say we take the fight to him doctor do you concur all right stark we go to him but you have to understand if it comes to saving you or the kid or the time stone i will not hesitate to let either of you die i cant because the universe depends on it nice good moral compass were straight all right kid youre an avenger now i thought you might be hungry i always hated that chair so ive been told even so id hoped youd sit in it one day i hated this room this ship i hated my life you told me that too every day for almost  years i was a child when you took me i saved you no no we were happy on my home planet going to bed hungry scrounging for scraps your planet was on the brink of collapse im the one who stopped that do you know whats happened since then the children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies its a paradise because you murdered half the planet a small price to pay for salvation youre insane little one its a simple calculus this universe is finite its resources finite if life is left unchecked life will cease to exist it needs correction you dont know that im the only one who knows that at least im the only one with the will to act on it for a time you had that same will as you fought by my side daughter im not your daughter everything i hate about myself you taught me and in doing so made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy thats why i trusted you to find the soul stone im sorry i disappointed you i am disappointed but not because you didnt find it but because you did and you lied nebula dont do this some time ago your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me please dont do this and very nearly succeeded so i brought her here to talk stop stop it i swear to you on my life i never found the soul stone accessing memory files you know what hes about to do hes finally ready and hes going for the stones  all of them  he can never get them all he will he cant nebula because i found the map to the soul stone and i

motivators they really clear the mind so im good to go yeah but this thanos were talkin about hes the toughest there is  well hes never fought me  yeah he has hes never fought me twice and im getting a new hammer dont forget it better be some hammer you know im  years old ive killed twice as many enemies as that and every one of them wouldve rather killed me but none succeeded im only alive because fate wants me alive thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards and hell be the latest to feel my vengeance fate wills it so mmmhmm and what if youre wrong if im wrong then what more

conflict how many did you see  how many did we win one the stone had better be up there for your sisters sake welcome thanos son of alars gamora daughter of thanos you know us it is my curse to know all who journey here where is the soul stone you should know it extracts a terrible price i am prepared we all think that at first we are all wrong how is it you know this place so well a lifetime ago i too sought the stones i even held one in my hand but it cast me out banished me here guiding others to a treasure i cannot possess what you seek lies in front of you as does what you fear whats this the price soul holds a special place among the infinity stones you might say it has a certain wisdom tell me what it needs to ensure that whoever possesses it understands its power the stone demands a sacrifice of what in order to take the stone you must lose that which you love a soul for a soul all my life i dreamed of a day a moment when you got what you deserved and i was always so disappointed but now you kill and torture and you call it mercy the universe has judged you you asked it for a prize and it told you no you failed and do you wanna know why because you love nothing no one no really tears theyre not for him no this isnt love i ignored my destiny once i cannot do that again even for you im sorry little one no drop to  heading  i hope youre right about this or were gonna land a lot faster than you want to when you said we were going to open wakanda to the rest of the world this is not what i imagined and what did you imagine the olympics maybe even a starbucks should we bow yeah hes a king seems like im always thanking you for something  what are you doing uh we dont do that here so how big of an assault should we expect uh sir i think you should expect quite a big assault how we looking you will have my kingsguard the border tribe the dora milaje and and a semistable yearold man how you been buck uh not bad for the end of the world whoa the structure is polymorphic right we had to attach each neuron nonsequentially why didnt you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively because we didnt think of it im sure you did your best can you do it yes

solution genocide but random dispassionate fair to rich and poor alike they called me a madman and what i predicted came to pass congratulations youre a prophet im a survivor who wants to murder trillions with all six stones i could simply snap my fingers they would all cease to exist i call that mercy and then what id finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe the hardest

happened binarily augmented retroframing or barf god i gotta work on that acronym an extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to sighs clear traumatic memories blowing huh it doesnt change the fact that they never made it to the airport or all the things i did to avoid processing my grief but plus  million for my little therapeutic experiment no one in their right mind wouldve ever funded it help me out whats the mit mission statement to generate disseminate students reciting and preserve knowledge and work with others to bring it to bear on the worlds great challenges well you are the others and quiet as its kept the challenges facing you are the greatest mankinds ever known  plus most of you are broke  all laughing oh im sorry rather you were as of this moment every

just reframe the future starting now go break some eggs all cheering wow wow that took my breath away oh tony so generous so much money wow laughs awkwardly out of curiosity will any portion of that

the meat shaft mr stark i am so sorry about the teleprompter i didnt know miss potts had cancelled they didnt have time to fix it its fine ill be right back well catch up later that was nice what you did for those young people ah they deserve it plus it helps ease my conscience they say theres a correlation between generosity and guilt but if youve got the money break as many eggs as you like right are you going up im right where i want to be okay hey sorry its an occupational hazard i work for the state department human resources i know its boring but it enabled me to raise a son im very proud of what he grew up to be his name was charlie spencer you murdered him in sokovia not that that matters in the least to you you think you fight for us you just fight for yourself whos going to avenge my son stark hes dead and i blame you female news anchor  wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the avengers and a group of mercenaries in lagos nigeria last month the traditionally reclusive wakandans were on an outreach mission in lagos when the attack occurred our peoples blood is spilled on foreign soil not only because of the actions of criminals but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them victory at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all female news anchor the wakandan king went on to male pundit on tv they are operating outside and above the international law because thats the reality if we dont respond to acts like these what legal authority does an enhanced individual like wanda maximoff have to operate in nigeri its my fault thats not true turn the tv back on theyre being very specific i shouldve clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it rumlow said bucky and all of a sudden i was a yearold kid again in brooklyn and people died its on me its on both of us this job we try to save as many people as we can sometimes that doesnt mean everybody but if we cant find a way to live with that then next time maybe nobody gets saved vis we talked about this yes but the door was open so i assumed that captain rogers wished to know when mr stark was arriving thank you well be right down ill use the door oh and apparently hes brought a guest steve we know who it is the secretary of state secretary ross sighs five years ago i had a heart attack and dropped right in the middle of my backswing turned out it was the best round of my life because after  hours of surgery and a triple bypass i found something  years in the army had never taught me perspective the world owes the avengers an unpayable debt you have fought for us protected us risked your lives but while a great many people see you as heroes there are some who would prefer the word vigilantes what word would you use mr secretary how about dangerous what would you call a group of usbased enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who frankly seem unconcerned about what they leave behind new york people screaming washington dc people screaming sokovia lagos siren wailing okay thats enough for the past four years youve operated with unlimited power and no supervision thats an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate but i think we have a solution the sokovia accords approved by  countries it states that the avengers shall no longer be a private organization instead theyll operate under the supervision of a united nations panel only when and if that panel deems it necessary the avengers were formed to make the world a safer place i feel weve done that tell me captain do you know where thor and banner are right now if i misplaced a couple of  megaton nukes you can bet thered be consequences compromise reassurance thats how the world works believe me this is the middle ground so there are contingencies three days from now the un meets in vienna to ratify the accords talk it over and if we come to a decision you dont like then you retire vehicle crashing man hello is this your car out front i jumped the kerb maybe we could take care of it ourselves if you wanna call the cops thats okay too  i guess  no no cops thank you clatters karpov straining you have kept your looks colonel congratulations mission report december   who are you my name is zemo i will repeat my question mission report december   how did you find me when shield fell black widow released hydra files to the public millions of pages much of it encrypted not easy to decipher but i have experience and patience a man can do anything if he has those what do you want mission report december   go to hell breathing heavily hydra deserves its place on the ash heap so your death would not bother me but id have to use this book and other bloodier methods to find what i need i dont look forward to that youd only be dying for your pride hail hydra choking secretary ross has a congressional medal of honour which is one more than you have sam so lets say we agree to this thing how long is it gonna be before they lojack us like a bunch of common criminals  countries want to sign this  sam and youre just like no thats cool we got it how long are you going to play both sides i have an equation oh this will clear it up in the eight years since mr stark announced himself as iron man the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially during the same period the number of potentially worldending events has risen at a commensurate rate are you saying its our fault im saying there may be a causality our very strength invites challenge challenge incites conflict and conflict breeds catastrophe oversight oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand boom natasha tony you are being uncharacteristically nonhyperverbal its because hes already made up his mind boy you know me so well actually im nursing an electromagnetic headache thats whats going on cap its just pain its discomfort whos putting coffee grounds in the disposal am i running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang sighs oh thats charles spencer by the way hes a great kid computer engineering degree  gpa had a floorlevel gig at intel planned for the fall but first he wanted to put a few miles on his soul before he parked it behind a desk see the world maybe be of service charlie didnt want to go to vegas or fort lauderdale which is what i would do he didnt go to paris or amsterdam which sounds fun he decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor guess where sokovia he wanted to make a difference i suppose we wont know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass theres no decisionmaking process here we need to be put in check whatever form that takes im game if we cant accept limitations if were boundaryless were no better than the bad guys tony someone dies on your watch you dont give up who said were giving up we are if were not taking responsibility for our actions this document just shifts the blame im sorry steve that is dangerously arrogant this is the united nations were talking about its not the world security council its not shield its not hydra no but its run by people with agendas and agendas change thats good thats why im here when i realised what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands i shut it down and stopped manufacturing tony you chose to do that if we sign this we surrender our right to choose what if this panel sends us somewhere we dont think we should go what if there is somewhere we need to go and they dont let us we may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own if we dont do this now its gonna be done to us later thats the fact that wont be pretty youre saying theyll come for me we would protect you natasha maybe tonys right if we have one hand on the wheel we can still steer if we take it off arent you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago im just reading the terrain we have made some very public mistakes we need to win their trust back focus up im sorry did i just mishear you  or did you agree with me  i want to take it back now no you cant retract it thank you unprecedented mobile buzzing okay case closed i win i have to go choir singing hymn and now i would like to invite sharon carter to come up and say a few words exhales shakily margaret carter was known to most as a founder of shield but i just knew her as aunt peggy she had a photograph in her office aunt peggy standing next to jfk as a kid that was pretty cool but it was a lot to live up to which is why i never told anyone we were related i asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either she said compromise where you can but where you cant dont even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right even if the whole world is telling you to move it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree look them in the eye and say no you move when i came out of the ice i thought everyone i had known was gone then i found out she was alive i was just lucky to have her she had you back too who else signed tony rhodey vision clint says hes retired  wanda  tbd im off to vienna for the signing of the accords theres plenty of room on the jet sighs just because its the path of least

the most of it update me on the structural and compositional analysis jarvis the sceptre is alien there are elements i cant quantify so theres elements you can the jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside something powerful like a reactor like a computer i believe im deciphering code are you sure hes gonna be okay pretending to need this guy really brings the team together dr cho theres no possibility of deterioration the nanomolecular functionality is instantaneous his cells dont know theyre bonding with simulacra shes creating tissue if you brought him to my lab the regeneration cradle could do this in  minutes oh hes flatlining call it time barton no no no im gonna live forever laughs im gonna be made of plastic stark heres your beverage youll be made of you mr

exactly the plan and helen i expect to see you at the party on saturday unlike you i dont have a lot of time for parties will thor be there  banner whats the rumpus  well the sceptre you see we were wondering how strucker got so inventive so ive been analysing the gem inside you may recognise  jarvis  jarvis doctor started out jarvis was just a natural language ui now he runs the iron legion he runs more of the business  than anyone besides pepper  oh  top of the line  yes jarvis i suspect not for long meet the competition  its beautiful  if you had to guess  whats it look like its doing  like its thinking i mean this could be  its not a human mind  mmmmmm i mean look at this theyre like neurons firing down in struckers lab i saw some fairly advanced robotics work they deepsixed the data but i gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door artificial intelligence this could be it bruce this could be the key to creating ultron both chuckle softly i thought ultron was a fantasy yesterday it was if we can harness this power apply it to my iron legion protocol thats a mansized if our job is if what if you were sipping margaritas on a sundrenched beach turning brown instead of green not looking over your shoulder for veronica dont hate i helped design veronica as a worstcase measure right how about a best case what if the world was safe what if next time aliens roll up to the club and they will they couldnt get past the bouncer the only people threatening the planet would be people i want to apply this to the ultron program but jarvis cant download a data schematic this dense we can only do it while we have the sceptre here thats three days give me three days so youre going for artificial intelligence and you dont want to tell the team right thats right you know why because we dont have time for a city hall debate i dont want to hear the man was not meant to meddle medley i see a suit of armour around the world sounds like a cold world tony ive seen colder this one this very vulnerable blue one it needs ultron peace in our time imagine that stark what did we miss jarvis ill continue to run variations on the interface but you should probably

man shows himself oh im sure they do but you needed something more than a man thats why you let stark take the sceptre i didnt expect but i saw starks fear i knew it would control him make him selfdestruct everyone creates the thing they dread men of peace create engines of war invaders create avengers people create smaller people uh children chuckles i lost the word there children designed to supplant them to help them end is that why youve come to end the avengers ive come to save the world but also yeah well move out right away this is a start but theres something we need to begin the real work  all of these are  ultron me i have what the avengers never will harmony theyre discordant disconnected starks already got them turning on each other and when you get inside the rest of

mightiest heroes pulled us apart like cotton candy seems like you walked away all right is that a problem i dont trust a guy without a dark side call me oldfashioned well lets just say you havent seen it yet you know ultron is trying to tear us apart right well i guess youd know whether youd tell us is a bit of a question banner and i were doing research  that would affect the team  that would end the team isnt that the mission isnt that the why we fight so we can end the fight so we get to go home every time someone tries to win a war before it starts innocent people die every time im sorry mr

dangerous id be disappointed if it wasnt fury ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time my contacts all say hes building something the amount of vibranium he made off with i dont think its just one thing what about ultron himself fury oh hes easy to track hes everywhere the guy is multiplying faster than a catholic rabbit it still doesnt help us get an angle on any of his plans though is he still going after launch codes fury yes he is but hes not making any headway i cracked the pentagons firewall in high school on a dare well i contacted our friends at the nexus about that nexus banner its the world internet hub in oslo every byte of data flows through there fastest access on earth so what did they say fury hes fixated on the missiles but the codes are constantly being changed by whom parties unknown do we have an ally ultrons got an enemy thats not the same thing still id pay folding money to know who it is i might need to visit oslo find our unknown well this is good times boss but i was kind of hoping when i saw you youd have more than that i do i have you back in the day i had eyes everywhere ears everywhere else you kids had all the tech you could dream up here we all are back on earth with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world ultron says the avengers are the only thing between him and his mission and whether or not he admits it his mission is global destruction all this laid in a grave so stand outwit the platinum bastard steve doesnt like that kind of talk you know what romanoff so what does he want to become better better than us  he keeps building bodies  person bodies the human form is inefficient biologically speaking were outmoded but he keeps coming back to it when you two programmed him to protect the human race you

machine  so it doesnt count no its not like a person lifting the hammer right different rules for us  nice guy artificial  rogers thank you he can wield the hammer he can keep the mind stone its safe with the vision and these days safe is in short supply but if you put the hammer in an elevator  it would still go up  elevators not worthy im gonna miss these little talks of ours not if you dont leave i have no choice the mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones to show up in the last few years its not a coincidence someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us
